It has a lot of moving parts and relies heavily on Kubernetes.
There are many subprojects, and each subproject has a complex set of dependencies. Setting up all those dependencies is usually complex and time consuming.
I have worked in a project where it used to take literally a couple of days to get everything ready to code. Also, you were never sure that everything was set up correctly because the dependencies were constantly changing.</description></item><item><title>Apache OpenServerless started</title><link>/blog/2024/07/09/apache-openserverless-started/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/07/09/apache-openserverless-started/</guid><description>The Apache OpenServerless project&amp;rsquo;s goal is to build a serverless distribution that runs in all major flavors of Kubernetes in public and private clouds, and in any virtual machine running Linux in any cloud. It is not just a serverless engine, but a complete set of integrated tools to easily build cloud-native applications, with a focus on building AI applications.
Specifically, we are building on top of Apache OpenWhisk, which includes Apache Kafka and Apache CouchDB as components, adding Apache APISix as an API gateway, and a set of custom runtimes.</description></item><item><title>The Name OpenServerless Was Approved</title><link>/blog/2024/06/20/the-name-openserverless-was-approved/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/06/20/the-name-openserverless-was-approved/</guid><description>We are in the process of submitting thr open source codebase of Nuvolaris Community, to the Apache Software Foundation as an Apache project, and our proposed name is Apache OpenServerless.
The name is excellent because it conveys what the project is: a complete serverless environment for running cloud-native applications anywhere.We have already written the proposal and found our champions and mentors.
