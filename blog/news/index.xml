&lt;p>Apache OpenServerless is an innovative project from the Apache Incubator, designed to deliver a versatile and scalable serverless environment compatible with any cloud provider or Kubernetes distribution. Built upon the robust Apache OpenWhisk framework, it aims to empower developers to create applications of any complexity, from simple forms to advanced AI-driven solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently in its preview phase, Apache OpenServerless invites the community to provide feedback and contributions, accelerating its journey towards a stable release.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assembling the lab for OpenServerless</title><link>/blog/2024/07/12/assembling-the-lab-for-openserverless/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/07/12/assembling-the-lab-for-openserverless/</guid><description>&lt;img src="/blog/devenv.png" alt="Development environment as a laboratory" class="mb-2 img-fluid">
&lt;p>OpenServerless is a complex project. It has a lot of moving parts and relies heavily on Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many subprojects, and each subproject has a complex set of dependencies. Setting up all those dependencies is usually complex and time consuming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have worked in a project where it used to take literally a couple of days to get everything ready to code. Also, you were never sure that everything was set up correctly because the dependencies were constantly changing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Apache OpenServerless started</title><link>/blog/2024/07/09/apache-openserverless-started/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/07/09/apache-openserverless-started/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Apache OpenServerless project&amp;rsquo;s goal is to build a serverless distribution that runs in all major flavors of Kubernetes in public and private clouds, and in any virtual machine running Linux in any cloud. It is not just a serverless engine, but a complete set of integrated tools to easily build cloud-native applications, with a focus on building AI applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Specifically, we are building on top of Apache OpenWhisk, which includes Apache Kafka and Apache CouchDB as components, adding Apache APISix as an API gateway, and a set of custom runtimes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Name OpenServerless Was Approved</title><link>/blog/2024/06/20/the-name-openserverless-was-approved/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/06/20/the-name-openserverless-was-approved/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are in the process of submitting thr open source codebase of Nuvolaris Community, to the Apache Software Foundation as an Apache project, and our proposed name is Apache OpenServerless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name is excellent because it conveys what the project is: a complete serverless environment for running cloud-native applications anywhere.We have already written the proposal and found our champions and mentors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But before we voted the project in the Incubator PMC, we wanted to make sure that the chosen name was available.There was some concern because the name &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; is already trademarked, although we found that combinations using the name &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; are disjointly trademarked, so it should work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Accepted for Incubation!</title><link>/blog/2024/06/18/project-accepted-for-incubation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/06/18/project-accepted-for-incubation/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is official!

We are going to develop our Nuvolaris Community into a worldwide open source project at the highest level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal is to provide the open source foundation of our Nuvolaris Enterprise product as a vendor independent and stable project maintained by a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To achieve this goal, we have submitted the Apache OpenServerless proposal is the natual step. The link to the proposal can be found &lt;a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/OpenServerlessProposal">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
