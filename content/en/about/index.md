<br/>
Here are some of the operator's strong points:
<br/>
<br/>
The first operator capable of configuring a complete OpenWhisk distribution on various versions of Kubernetes, both on cloud providers and on bare metal.
<br/>
<br/>
The operator takes care of resources setup and mainteinance.
<br/>
<br/>
Allows you to configure a set of resources to be used for the development / deployment of cloud native applications based on the OpenWhisk serverless engine: redis, postgresql, minio and much more!

The <strong>ops</strong> cli is more than a standard cli: infact it is...
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>rich</strong> - yes, it includes installation, system administration, debugging, developing tools and much much more!
<br/>
<strong>extensible</strong> - easily extendable by writing simple plugins in shell or javascript.
<br/>
<strong>whisk-ready</strong> - it includes all openwhisk tools.
