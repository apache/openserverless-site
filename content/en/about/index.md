# Managed by a Kubernetes Operator {.text-center}

Here are some of the operator's strong points:

The first operator capable of configuring a complete OpenWhisk distribution on various versions of Kubernetes, 
both on cloud providers and on bare metal.

The operator takes care of resources setup and maintenance.

Allows you to configure a set of resources to be used for the development / deployment of cloud native applications 
based on the OpenWhisk serverless engine: redis, postgresql, minio and much more!

more!

_EXTENSIBLE_ - easily extendable by writing simple plugins in shell or javascript.
