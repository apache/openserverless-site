Hello everyone, we are happy to announce that we submitted the  OpenServerless project to the Apache Software Foundation. We  are going to develop our Nuvolaris Community into a worldwide open source project at the highest level. 

The goal is to provide the open source foundation of our Nuvolaris Enterprise  product as a vendor independent and stable project maintained by a community.

To achieve this goal, we have submitted the Apache OpenServerless proposal is the natual step. The link to the proposal can be found [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/OpenServerlessProposal).


Our codebase is well tested and already has a number of paying and open source customers. We already have a network of contributors who have already contributed to the codebase and we have found the mentors for our project and the champion for the project.

But what is the Nuvolaris community (to become Apache OpenServerless)? There is already an open source serverless engine (Apache OpenWhisk) and I am one of the PMC of the project and also wrote an O'Reilly book about it: Learning Apache OpenWhisk. 

What is missing now is a complete distribution including integrated services to build a complete platform. We want the Apache OpenServerless project to fill this gap.

With Nuvolaris Community we provide storage, databases, caches, frontend, IDE, starters and even LLM support on top of OpenWhisk. We have made this available and running on all major cloud provider Kubernetes platforms (EKS, AKS, GKE, LKE) and also for the Kubernetes of all major Linux distributions (RedHat OpenShift, Ubuntu MicroK8S, SuSE K3S).

Simply put, if OpenWhisk is Linux, then Nuvolaris is RedHat. The OpenServerless project aims to be the first complete open source distribution that makes it easy to build cloud-native applications with portability in mind. 

And we want to build the platform in the open, contributing our work to the Apache Software Foundation to make it widely available and get more vendors involved in supporting it.
