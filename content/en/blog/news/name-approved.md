We are in the process of submitting thr open source codebase of Nuvolaris Community, to the Apache Software Foundation as an Apache project, and our proposed name is Apache OpenServerless.

The name is excellent because it conveys what the project is: a complete serverless environment for running cloud-native applications anywhere.We have already written the proposal and found our champions and mentors.

But before we voted the project in the Incubator PMC, we wanted to make sure that the chosen name was available.There was some concern because the name "serverless" is already trademarked, although we found that combinations using the name "serverless" are disjointly trademarked, so it should work.

To resolve this, we initiated research with the Apache Trademark team to be sure the nome was usable. The research took some time, but the result was: approved!So now we are ready to vote and get the process approved by the community and start building the next standard in the open source world: Apache OpenServerless!
