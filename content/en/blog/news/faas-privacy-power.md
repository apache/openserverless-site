## Introduction
Apache OpenServerless is an innovative project from the Apache Incubator, designed to deliver a versatile and scalable serverless environment compatible with any cloud provider or Kubernetes distribution. Built upon the robust Apache OpenWhisk framework, it aims to empower developers to create applications of any complexity, from simple forms to advanced AI-driven solutions.

Currently in its preview phase, Apache OpenServerless invites the community to provide feedback and contributions, accelerating its journey towards a stable release.

## Key Features of Apache OpenServerless  
Apache OpenServerless integrates three core components that collectively form a complete serverless ecosystem:

### Serverless Engine Powered by Apache OpenWhisk
At the heart of Apache OpenServerless lies Apache OpenWhisk, a distributed and scalable open-source platform for executing serverless functions. OpenWhisk enables dynamic execution of lightweight code snippets, or "Actions," written in multiple programming languages. These Actions respond to events (via triggers) or HTTP requests, seamlessly adapting to various workloads.

### Application Services
To support various application needs, Apache OpenServerless provides a set of pre-configured services, including:
- an S3 compatible storage,
- a Redis compatible caching,
- MongoDB and PostgreSQL for both noSQL and SQL.

### Developer-Friendly Tools
To streamline development, Apache OpenServerless offers:
- Ready-to-use application templates - kickstarting projects for various use cases.  
  -Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - the system offers a user-friendly CLI for seamless interaction with the serverless platform.  Furthermore a VScode extension is available.
- Simplified deployment workflows - to build, test, and launch cloud-ready applications with ease.

### Installs everywhere and control data
OpenServerless is trying to set new standards in the Function as a Service (FaaS) landscape. Built on Kubernetes and Apache OpenWhisk, OpenServerless offers an infrastructure-agnostic approach that can be installed on-premises or in public clouds. This flexibility ensures that data remains under the control of the organization, addressing key privacy concerns for industries with strict data governance requirements. By providing companies with the option to run their applications on their terms, OpenServerless aligns with the demand for transparent and secure data handling in a serverless environment.

## Conclusion

OpenServerless also benefits from the robust, scalable nature of Kubernetes, making it ideal for handling asynchronous, event-driven workloads that are core to modern serverless applications. With OpenWhisk’s powerful action-based execution model, it provides a straightforward framework for developers to deploy and manage functions seamlessly. The addition of observability tools allows developers to monitor performance, making it easy to optimize and troubleshoot.

In essence, OpenServerless is more than just a FaaS—it's a privacy-focused, Kubernetes-native solution that empowers companies to innovate securely and effectively. With its unique approach to data control and its ability to support intensive workloads, OpenServerless is reshaping the serverless ecosystem and opening up exciting new applications for AI-powered, cloud-native solutions.
