## Rules

Once we have a trigger and some actions, we can create rules for the
trigger. A rule connects the trigger with an action, so if you fire the
trigger, it will invoke the action. Letâ€™s see this in practice in the
next listing.

### Create data

First of all, create a file called **alert.js**.

```javascript
function main() {
    console.log("Suspicious activity!");
    return {
        result: "Suspicious activity!"
    };
}
```

Then, create a OpenServerless action for this file:

```bash
ops action create alert alert.js
```

Now, create a trigger that weâ€™ll call **notifyAlert**:

```bash
ops trigger create notifyAlert
```

Now, all is ready, and now we can create our rule! The syntax follows
this pattern: "ops rule create {ruleName} {triggerName} {actionName}".

```bash
ops rule create alertRule notifyAlert alert
```

### Test your rule

Our environment can now be alerted if something suspicious occurs!
Before starting, letâ€™s open another terminal window and enable polling
(with the command `ops activation poll`) to see what happens.

```bash
$ ops activation poll
Enter Ctrl-c to exit.
Polling for activation logs
```

Itâ€™s time to fire the trigger!

```bash
$ ops trigger fire notifyAlert
ok: triggered /notifyAlert with id 86b8d33f64b845f8b8d33f64b8f5f887
```

Now, go to see the result! Check the terminal where you are polling
activations now!

```bash
Enter Ctrl-c to exit.
Polling for activation logs

Activation: 'alert' (dfb43932d304483db43932d304383dcf)
[
    "2024-02-20T03:15.15472494535Z stdout: Suspicious activity!"
]
```

## Conclusion

> ðŸ’¡ **NOTE**

> As with all the other commands, you can execute `list`, `update`, and
`delete` by name.

A trigger can enable multiple rules, so firing one trigger actually
activates multiple actions. Rules can also be enabled and disabled
without removing them. As in the last example, letâ€™s try to disable the
first rule and fire the trigger again to see what happens.

```bash
$ ops rule disable alertRule    
ok: disabled rule alertRule
$ ops trigger fire notifyAlert  
ok: triggered /_/notifyAlert with id 0f4fa69d910f4c738fa69d910f9c73af
```

- Disabling the rule.

- Firing the trigger again.

In the activation polling window, we can see that no action is executed
now. Of course, we can enable the rule again with:

    ops rule enable alertRule
