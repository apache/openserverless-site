Welcome to OpenServerless Developer guide.

OpenServerless is based on [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org)
and the documentation in this section is derived for the official
OpenWhisk documentation.

In this sections we mostly document how to write [**actions**
(functions)](#actions.adoc), the building blocks of OpenWhisk and
OpenServerless applications. There are also a few related entities for
managing actions (packages, parameters etc) you also need to know.

You can write actions in a number of programming languages. OpenServerless
supports directly [this list of programming
languages](#index-runtimes.adoc). The list is expanding over the time.

See below for documentation related to:

- [OpenWhisk Entities](entities)

- [OpenServerless Runtimes](runtimes)

- [OpenServerless `ops` Tools](tools)

- [OpenServerless `ops` Tasks](tasks)

- [Advanced Reference Documentation](references)

There is also a [tutorial and a development
kit](#actions-actionloop.adoc) to build your own runtime for your
favorite programming language.
