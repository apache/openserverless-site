## About Apache OpenServerless

Apache OpenServerless is an Open Source project, released under the
[Apache License
2.0](https://github.com/apache/openserverless/blob/main/LICENSE)
providing a portable and complete
[Serverless](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html) 
environment, allowing to build quickly and easily cloud-native
applications.

Our goal is to make OpenServerless **ubitiquous**, allowing it to easily
run a complete and portable environment that runs in every
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

OpenServerless is based on [Apache
OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org), which provides a powerful,
production-ready serverless engine.

However, the serverless engine is just the beginning, because a
serverless environment requires a set of integrated services.

OpenServerless provides integrated with OpenWhisk several additional
services such as databases, object storage, and a cron scheduler.

Furthermore, we test it on many public cloud Kubernetes services and
on-premises Kubernetes vendors.

The platform is paired with a powerful CLI tool, `ops`, which lets you
deploy OpenServerless quickly and easily everywhere, and perform a lot
of development tasks.

Our goal is to build a **complete** distribution of a serverless
environment with the following features:

- It is easy to install and manage.

- Integrates all the key services to build applications.

- It is as portable as possible to run potentially in every
    Kubernetes.

- It is however tested regularly against a set of supported Kubernetes
    environments.
