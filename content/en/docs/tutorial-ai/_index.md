## AI Tutorial
We are transcribing all the lessons done for the MastroGPT AI tutorial.

The ultimate goal is to build a consistent and well-structured documentation set based on the original course content, enabling easier access, referencing, and further processing.

The transcription process begins by leveraging the auto-generated captions provided by Google Drive for each recorded lesson. These initial drafts are then reviewed and refined on a per-lesson basis to ensure accuracy and clarity.
