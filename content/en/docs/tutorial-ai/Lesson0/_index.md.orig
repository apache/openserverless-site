## Lesson 0
transcript here:
0:00
hello everyone and welcome to the course application development with LLM open 
0:06
using Apache open serverless a mileage title worthy of Wart Muller but it's the
0:11
Mastro GPT course for friends the first step is: start the environment.
0:18
environment that at this moment I have already started you can do it by simply
0:23
going here on GitHub/mastrogpt and you will find here
0:29
the slide shows it. it says to go to GitHub master GPT you will find the
0:34
starter and from here you have to press the code button and launch the code
0:39
space so you see go to master GPT launch the starter here is this code button and
0:47
here it appears to make a button this one create code space on main I have
0:52
already launched it because otherwise it takes a while to start so you see that
0:57
this is already active it's what I'm working with it's not the only job
1:01
option so you don't have to you are not obliged to use the code space on the web
1:07
because not everyone likes to work in the cloud like I'm doing however but it
1:12
is convenient than both for training and for other reasons for this reason for
1:19
this reason I use it and I recommend you to use it too because it saves you a lot
1:24
a lot of time to configure the things but if you want you can configure yours
1:28
as you want so at this point once launched all this will start and above
1:33
all you will have to have these icons which I'm matting here at the beginning
1:39
the icon icon with the little cloud which actually starts this this
1:44
extension which has the main functions of the and the first button is the login
1:48
button so the first step is to log in to open serverless so the first step is to
1:54
write your name your username and password and log in and then you should
1:59
see this message you successfully logged in you can now use open serless here is
2:06
the message and all therefore first step actually this this I am paying for is
2:12
not the first lesson it is the pre-lessson the zero module to
2:16
initialize to verify that everything works and understand if everything is
2:20
okay in short so if everything is fine you will see the extension you will see
2:25
the login and you can log in and start working let's take a tour of the
2:30
environment so it is important in addition to the little cloud this other
2:35
icon the test tube who it must also show the tests therefore the tests that are
2:42
there however for everything so you should see by clicking on the cloud icon
2:47
the extension clicking on the icon of the test tube you will see the tests and
2:53
then there is one more thing to see this lesson here you will have to go to the
2:57
docs icon on the documents icon you will see the list of all the documents under
3:03
lessons you can find this text which is the slide you only see the source but
3:09
actually just click on preview and you can see the slide real already rendering
3:15
and we also use the source because sometimes we take and use the sources to
3:21
take the exercises etc so it's convenient to have the slide in markdown
3:26
in source so this slide it recapitulates the various parts document test research
3:34
research is useful for example to find points in the source where you need to
3:40
intervene to do the exercises okay then so recapping documents search testing
3:47
the open serverless icon and here are the buttons to perform the tests the
3:52
first step is to deploy then go to the deploy icon that if you don't deploy you
3:59
can't run the tests so now he's taking the initial code and is installing it
4:06
here now you can go here and run the test and therefore everything works
4:11
because the test passes okay now when you work you don't deploy but go into
4:18
development mode which also allows you to see the user interface so now let's
4:23
also try this other feature which is on "devel" will open here too the deployment
4:30
window and now some of you will even see an open button in browser if you don't
4:35
see it this is a bit hidden it is explained in the slide in the slide this
4:40
small detail is explained which is a bit hidden there is this antenna below this
4:46
antenna below simply shows the ports the ports of the services launched then
4:52
devel launches a web server to run the user interface so you simply have to
4:57
click here it opens and to see it this icon of the globe also hidden but there
5:02
is the slide that explains it and here you can log in then you can log in and
5:07
since you are master GPT reference to master Geppetto we have called the user
5:13
interface with great effort of imagination Pinocchio so you can log in
5:18
Pinocchio the default password is already Geppetto the initial password is
5:24
Pinocchio or Geppetto anyway we change it immediately so no problem obviously she
5:30
immediately tells me that she is not sure in fact now I'll show you how to
5:35
change it here in part of the user interface so here I am going to give you
5:40
a tour then this is user interface so all the resort will use Python as a
5:46
programming language but we have developed a user interface that serves
5:50
as a front end for the applications that we will use to make the course but then
5:55
you don't have to modify it because this will remain more or less fixed you will
6:00
simply develop chats so this is the multi-hat application so the first chat
6:07
just to see if everything works is called hello and does nothing but say
6:12
hello to whatever you write to him then hello Michelle Mela hello Mela etc and
6:19
then here there is a chat a little more interesting which is instead the demo of
6:24
the characteristics of Pinocchio of this interface so basically that this
6:30
interface can display code see you can also close this side view so when
6:37
something is produced that it is interesting part of the side view to
6:41
view it or you can view HTML or a chessboard here therefore the support
6:49
for so if I ask form shows me a form and I write on it because it's good we use
6:58
this in the exercises CEO etc and here it gives me the result of the form this
7:05
is fine so you understand that here there is an extendable menu this is the
7:10
menu and there is another thing which is the upload of documents so here you can
7:15
choose a document to upload it i'll show you this later how to use it the side
7:21
display is customizable so you can powerful extend it with your own
7:25
displays and the side view that can be open and closed and with this we have
7:31
seen this sums up the features of our interface last step the terminal because
7:37
we will use a lot of terminal because many many commands are command line and
7:43
therefore for this reason let's start immediately to show the command line
7:48
commands and as a command I show you immediately the terminal opens in
7:53
various ways the easiest way is to go here terminal new terminal and this
7:59
opens a terminal okay here let's do a command right away to change the
8:05
password then the password is actually stored here master GPT packages master
8:13
GPT login users but as you can see it is encrypted so it is not easy to change so
8:19
if I now decide to change the password therefore I give this command
8:25
ops ai user update Pinocchio and I put another password here I changed it here
8:33
I changed my password here the login is customizable so instead of using the
8:39
file you can use anything a database an external system whatever you want and of
8:45
course the easy implementation is that si increase users of the interface are
8:50
in the file that we can change which we have changed but when we change the
8:55
users we also have to redeploy so second command is ops ai deploy master gpt
9:02
login so now he deploys an action to me this is to show that you can otherwise
9:08
you could have gone here do deploy and we deployed them all this serves to make
9:14
it clear which also exist many command line commands that are used to do the
9:20
most advanced things when you work a lot with the command line then for those who
9:24
use code space let me give you a note here on GitHub a piece of advice go here
9:31
go to settings here are code space and here I recommend you to change
9:37
eventually the timeout because there are 120 hours free so you really do a lot
9:43
but it puts you the auto off time at 5 or 10 minutes maximum because otherwise
9:49
it consumes 30 minutes each time and if you forget it you quickly run out of
9:53
credit you can also decide to use and instead of Visual Studio on the web as I
10:00
did you can use the local one so you can change this option in reality it is
10:05
possible also do not use the environment in the cloud but use everything locally
10:12
with docker so you can also install nuvolaris locally instead of use what we
10:17
offer regarding all these things for those who are interested we can do an ad
10:22
hoc lesson in which I show how to install in a different way however for
10:28
the course we have provided this environment ultra simplified which
10:32
should allow everyone to start with practically zero effort then course
10:38
support what is available first of all as a support to the nuvolaris course
10:44
enterprise available to everyone with a free account which as you can see
10:48
includes several services so it includes Redis understands Mino includes postgres
10:55
SQL although in this course I don't think I'll use it you can deploy on AWS
11:01
G-Cloud Azure Akamai on physical servers we for example use Hezner on Ubuntu on Red
11:08
Hat Open Shift so you to get an account on the our open serverless environment
11:14
where you can practice ask now so if you have already written account we
11:20
are already preparing it for you or you can go to the
11:24
mastrogpt.com website where there is a chatbot and you can ask for it here or
11:29
you can contact us on LinkedIn and there you send a message on LinkedIn or you
11:34
can install it yourself on the open serverless site where there is all the
11:39
documentation for the installation so how to install it etc as for support
11:44
there is Discord i ask you and I recommend you to use that so go to
11:49
Discord and here we are there are already the first people this is a brand
11:54
new server this is the second lesson so come and this is where we offer support
12:00
possibly use the Italian channel because the language and then there's always
12:06
Reddit there is also Reddit which is a forum and here you can ask your
12:11
questions and discuss etc so these are the course support options we offer the
12:17
next step and with this I conclude the first module even in reality this as
12:22
mentioned is lesson zero then we will do the first real lesson go still on the
12:28
extension then therefore here you see click on the lessons and here simply
12:35
click on the first lesson so here is downloading all the lessons downloaded
12:41
the lessons and so we are ready to start and move on to the next lesson
