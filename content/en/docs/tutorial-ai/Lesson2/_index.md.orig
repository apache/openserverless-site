## Lesson 2
transcript here:

0:00
welcome to the second lesson of the Open LLM course with Apache Open Serverless
0:05
for friends the course of Mastri GPT for private AI we start immediately by going
0:11
to the Mastro GPT site then GitHub Mastro GPT here you will find the
0:17
starter as explained in the first lesson which we can launch this way you will
0:23
have the environment pointing to our Mastro GPT sta repository on which you
0:28
obviously do not have right permissions so you should fork that is create a copy
0:33
of the environment and choose your account this way you can write all your
0:38
changes and save them without depending on the original so you can save
0:42
everything using the git version control tool here I have already made a fork as
0:47
you can see and I have launched the code space i repeat that you can also use the
0:52
local environment but simply for this course we will use the code space that
0:57
allows you to work quickly without too much effort and without having to
1:01
configure by hand then click on create code space and you will see this screen
1:06
you should see the speech bubble which is our extension that allows you to log
1:10
in using the parameters we gave you in the first lesson you can log into the
1:15
open serverless environment that we provide at this point you see the
1:19
starter files basically empty by selecting the lessons you can select the
1:24
files of the second lesson in this way we are downloading all the files of the
1:29
second lesson each lesson is independent of the others so you don't have to have
1:34
the files of the first lesson to be able to use those of the second in the second
1:39
lesson you will find the lesson both in markdown format and in PDF format for
1:44
ease of reading so that you can also consult it by downloading the local so
1:49
this is the second lesson and we are going to talk about how to start
1:52
actually talking to LLMs by creating an LLM chat in which we will implement an
1:58
important feature that is streaming which is the ability to see what the LLM
2:03
produces along the way without having to wait until everything has been
2:06
completely generated and this makes interaction with these systems much more
2:11
immediate instead of waiting until the end for everything to come we will also
2:16
address a series of related topics so the plan of this lesson will be first of
2:21
all how to access the LLM and then we will learn how to manage the secrets
2:26
that allow you to access it then we will embark on streaming then we will put
2:31
everything together by accessing the LLM in streaming mode basically having you
2:36
implement it with an exercise before starting since I will use a lot of a
2:41
trick which is to copy lines and text from a file opened in the editor
2:45
directly from the terminal to repeat the experience I recommend you to configure
2:50
a key in my case control enter which allows you to copy the text from a file
2:55
to the terminal this is a feature present in studio code only that it is
3:00
not normally enabled by default so to enable it you have to go to settings i.e
3:05
the wheel in the bottom left select the keyboard shortcuts and we'll try run
3:12
selected text in active terminal this one you click on it and set your
3:17
preferred sequence for example I settl enter which allows me to copy the text
3:23
of the file into the terminal it is truly extremely comfortable and I
3:28
recommend it now let's start talking about how to access the LLM to access
3:33
the LLM we need the credentials the credentials we need are stored in
3:38
environment variables then I will explain exactly how they get there and
3:42
how to use them however these credentials are in the environment
3:46
variables Olma host which is the URL and for AUTH we use the credentials in
3:52
reality the credentials are the same ones that are used to log in to the
3:58
environment open serverless so the LLM is protected with the same credentials
4:03
as open serverless let's see it right away we do it by opening a terminal and
4:09
at the terminal we type this command ops ai CLI which launches an interactive
4:15
phyon environment and now I use the trick I was talking about i copy these
4:19
commands which are used to read the environment variables so as a first step
4:24
I import the O s module i tie the Ollama host variable and a UT this one you see
4:31
that we will use to access Ollama host now using these credentials you can get a
4:37
URL to access the llama server where we can invoke the LLMs in particular we
4:43
will use these commands i.e host note that here I am doing a technique which
4:48
is the one you have to follow in the code i.e every definitive function in
4:52
open serverless receives a diction called args i will always look for the
4:57
secret parameters in args and if I don't find them I search the environment this
5:02
is a technique that is used to be able to write code that takes secrets both in
5:07
the test environment and in the production environment so these are the
5:11
three commands to give and I'm going to give them like this so let's set the
5:15
empty yards to simulate in the command line what is done in test i take the
5:20
host I take the off and I compose a URL simply by putting the https prefix on it
5:27
using the key as username and password and at host our this URL that we have
5:33
called base is the URL we need to access to Llama password protected so if I
5:40
invoke beware of this exclamation mark which allows me to run while I'm in the
5:45
shell command editor without having to exit the shell and re-enter and I can
5:50
use variables so I basically run curl and in this way I invoked the URL to
5:56
access Llama and you can see that I got this message Llama is running now we see
6:01
that the credentials are correct now let's always see at the command line how
6:06
to access Llama therefore we have to use a simple API that basically uses JSON
6:13
messages that specify the template the prompt the stream false because we start
6:18
immediately by disabling the streaming which is easier and we get the whole
6:22
complete answer so let's set the llama as a model llama 3.1.8 billions which is
6:29
a model made by meta small enough to fit into the GPT we have as input we ask you
6:35
who are you and let's compose this message at this point using that URL the
6:41
base API/generate we can invoke it we invoke
6:46
it by executing a post therefore here now I import the request another Python
6:53
library which allows you to make HTTP calls and I make a post to the riquest
6:58
using the URL I composed and the message I composed and extract the result in
7:03
JSON on now from here the result will be the answer to my request who are you so
7:09
this is basically the generic way you interact with Llama with its API there
7:15
are also libraries that allow you to avoid composing messages but generally
7:20
it is convenient to know how to do it and in many cases it is not needed you
7:24
just need when the requests become complex then I always teach the
7:29
essential information and then complicate it with library when it
7:32
becomes necessary so we can try running this code right away let's set the model
7:38
first let's set the input let's compose a message let's compose the URL using
7:43
the base we prepared before and so now we have a full URL and a full message to
7:49
make the request to Llama asking him to use the llama 3.1.8b 8B template with
7:54
this prompt without streaming so now I do a post then we import requests we
8:01
make a request he performed all the result without streaming so now I get
8:06
this item here res which is all the complete answer that has various
8:10
information of this one I am only interested in extracting the answer that
8:14
I can print that's it like this I was able to quickly create a call and then
8:20
we can write our first function now I'll show you the code I made put inside the
8:25
code of a function so we simply open it the code is what we saw before let's
8:30
take the secrets then we compose a message being careful that the input is
8:35
not empty and we invoke it at this point we make the request we return the result
8:41
with boy and output as we have seen the previous time now we will do another
8:46
somewhat magical thing we'll expressly create the action from the file and pass
8:51
the parameters directly to it so one and two don't do that because this is to
8:57
understand how it works below because there is actually a feature that is
9:01
there in the deploy that automatically implements this feature but as you see
9:05
when you create a function or update so for this you can use update even if the
9:10
function does not exist it creates it in this package using a single file and
9:15
these parameters are enough for him obviously instead of doing this directly
9:20
we will use the deploy command which does a series of more complex actions
9:24
that I will now explain to you this is to understand what are the steps
9:29
necessary to do the deployment now this can be tried actually now since you need
9:34
to deploy everything else you also need the front end and so on i now perform a
9:40
complete deployment and go to C here we have the simple action that allows you
9:46
to converse without streaming so now it takes a while with Llama so we learned
9:52
how to create a simple LLM without streaming at the moment but we have
9:56
already made some steps forward by learning all the steps necessary to
10:01
build our system that will become seems more complex now we have stumbled over
10:06
the secrets which are necessary to be able to pass the information to Llama and
10:12
also to the other services for this modification we would have to answer
10:16
some questions where do the Llama host and O variables come from in reality
10:22
they come from many places the main source is the configuration that is
10:27
loaded when you log in here comes a whole series of information that is made
10:32
available both to the test environment and to the deployment environment they
10:37
are not available in shell for this reason I use it directly from the CLI
10:42
which instead sees them this information can be overwritten i.e you can add your
10:47
own by creating an env file or you can further create a packages env file that
10:54
puts additional variables but valid only for deployment and an additional env
11:01
which instead applies only to the if we go to check we see that there are values
11:06
I try to read these two variables then I try to look for them I make grep and you
11:11
see that I find llama new valeris.io IO if instead I do the GP of the test I see
11:17
that different words in general these values are different because the
11:23
variables for the test they are used to perform tests in a test environment
11:29
while the default variables are used for production therefore in the newis
11:33
deployment environment so the CLI looks at the test ones not those of production
11:40
but if someone goes to look at these variables which are available he
11:44
realizes that O is not in any of the env so if one tries to make this command by
11:50
looking for it in this case there is no output because because the information
11:54
is actually in the config that we can read with the command ops config dump
12:00
which lists them all let's make a nice GP and we see only the ones we want to
12:06
look for and in fact there is off so off we have it and we can pass it this one
12:12
is actually generally used to access all the features of your open serverless in
12:17
particular it is used to access Llama how are secrets propagated to actions the
12:23
way in which secrets propagate to actions is simply to pass on a command
12:27
line as I did before but it is quite an inconvenient thing because in practice
12:32
you would have to write a rather long command line each time to pass these
12:36
operations by the way this command can only be done from the CLI because these
12:42
variables are not visible from the shell then the problem is solved simply with
12:46
these annotations that begin with a sharp dash dash which basically allow
12:51
you to specify in the action the arguments to pass to the command line so
12:57
if I go and see the simple code you can see that above I have these three
13:01
annotations that are used to specify the parameters and these annotations are
13:06
able to read the environment variables of the configuration as well to use just
13:11
use ops IDE deploy all or just one function note that here I deploy a
13:16
function that is composed of its own file and here I have to specify the
13:20
extension alternatively if I have a directory I specify the directory and it
13:25
is zipped so in this case I do the deploy and you see that the deploy has
13:30
composed the action by passing all the parameters that are in the config in
13:36
this way from the login the secrets are prepaid to the actions in practice I
13:41
have revealed almost all the tricks of the secrets keep in mind that the tests
13:45
and CLI see the configuration on ENV and the test
13:51
envirment sees configuration environ that the CLI only sees test env
14:00
it makes sense because it is normally used to develop tests and not production
14:05
if you want to see what happens in production write an integration test
14:09
that doesn't need access to the variables as a rule to follow always use
14:15
secrets from the args and get a default by taking the equivalent value on the
14:19
environment this way you are able to have code that works both in production
14:23
and in testing note that you need to add the pums in the main file of an action
14:29
when it is a single file or in underscore main when an action is
14:36
multifile then deploy with ops IDE deploy and you will have all the
14:41
parameters passed for this reason it is never advisable to use the creation of
14:46
actions directly except for special cases when you have to debug here's a
14:51
few things about what ops IDE deploy does it's built on top of ops actions
14:56
and packages it currently supports Python Node and PHP we will also support
15:03
other create packages for the actions create zip for multifile actions
15:09
resolves dependencies so a requirement a packages JSON or the PHP composer it
15:17
extracts annotations and is used to propagate secrets and also integrates
15:22
with the upside devel by doing an interactive incremental deploy every
15:26
time you change something it only redeploys the function you changed with
15:31
this we have finished the discussion of secrets now let's focus on the other
15:35
topic of this lesson which is streaming how do you do streaming let's try
15:40
streaming from the command line right away let's import the libraries to
15:44
invoke now here I have created a URL in a quick way because I am in a test
15:49
environment don't do this do as I told you in general i create a message and
15:55
pass it to him note that this time the stream is true for this reason if I now
16:01
execute the result I will be given a streamed answer what is a stream in
16:06
Python it's an iterator so now I get an iterator from the answer this is a
16:12
particular object called a generator that can be executed with a four cycle
16:17
if I now execute the four you see that it produces not one but several answers
16:23
so the iterator is iterated each piece of response that the streamer is
16:27
returning is extracted so the requests from Llama are streamed note that the
16:33
format of each request has this format remember this because we will use it in
16:38
the exercise when you stream an Llama request he returns a sequence of Jun
16:43
that have the model response and the done flag until the last one says done
16:49
equals true and puts a series of additional information including context
16:54
duration and other information so here we have seen the iteration now let's
16:59
make a function that whole let's create for simplicity an iterator that counts
17:04
to zero by waiting for a second then count to zero i give it n puts a second
17:10
pause between one request and another this is to show the streaming that I can
17:15
try so if I now simply copy this code in the environment here I can test it and
17:21
see that it counts down to zero c is a dummy iterator that we can use to test
17:27
streaming and since we write in tests for everything we do then we will use a
17:32
socket to do the streaming the problem is this the actions when they are
17:37
performed are asynchronous so they are managed in a rather complex serverless
17:42
environment so they lose contact with the web server because the serverless
17:46
system is quite complex so to do the steaming that is only useful in special
17:51
cases there is a component called streamer that invokes the action and
17:55
passes it a socket to receive the intermediate results the socket is
18:00
passed in two parameters stream host and stream port by the way the door is
18:06
always changing so it is necessary so to do the streaming you will take the
18:10
parameters stream host and stream port you will have a socket and you will
18:15
connect to this socket and then along the way when you produce the output you
18:19
send the result to this socket this is the full streaming feature that you can
18:24
use with minor tweaks that depend on what you're streaming with this function
18:28
you receive an iterator and send it to the stream that was passed through the
18:32
arguments most of the time you can copy it like this i collect the result and
18:38
return it at the end all concatenated even though I have gradually sent the
18:42
intermediate steps but testing something like this is not easy that's why we have
18:48
a mock something called a stream mock that's able to simulate what's happening
18:52
on the stream so you can write code that uses the stream and test it locally to
18:57
see what effect it has so that when you send it to production it's already been
19:01
tested so using the mock everything is prepared args is created the mock is
19:07
created then both executes the stream you simply need to pass the args the
19:13
args are located where the stream is created from the mock so the code is the
19:18
same both in production and in testing and then the mock stops and you see the
19:23
results so now I'll show you how it works in the command line amount this is
19:29
necessary because it is used to refund the stream because it is in the test
19:33
folder import a stream and I'll give you the args you see this created me a host
19:40
stream is a random stream port that change every time and then using these
19:44
arguments I create the mock now he is practically listening something he will
19:49
receive okay this is normal because the mock wait 5 seconds and then and then
19:56
stops therefore so we have to do it quickly so now I'll show you how the
20:02
streamer works first of all I take this stream function and put it in the
20:07
command line so now I have this stream function and I can use the mock be
20:12
careful because the mock is a bit impatient because it waits 5 seconds and
20:16
then finishes this serves to prevent the texts from getting caught in fact if I
20:21
start and I don't do anything the mock times out and it dies because it waits 5
20:27
seconds at most however now I do it again because if there were no this time
20:31
out the mock could remain stuck indefinitely so now let's do the test we
20:37
have to hurry because we have 5 seconds so I now I launch the mock i take the
20:43
generator and launch the stream here it is it's steaming count to zero so it'll
20:48
be 10 seconds there there you go you're done now I can stop the mock and see the
20:54
result so you see that it produced the various results 9 8 7 5 4 3 this is to
21:03
understand how the mock basically simulates what the streamer does in
21:07
production now I'll show you the actual test code and test it then let's open
21:13
the countdown and countdown test code this is a countdown function this is the
21:18
iterator this is the streaming function then here is the main which as usual
21:23
reads an input gives default messages if there is no inpod it does a conversion
21:29
of the input into a numbery and then executes take the iterator and it does
21:34
the streaming a very important thing is that when you write a function you have
21:38
to return streaming equals true in this way the first response sustainably did
21:44
not stream but if you return streaming equals true the client and in particular
21:49
Pinocchio he knows he needs to do the streaming and so he will reinvoke the
21:54
request to the streamer so instead of calling the normal URL it will call a
21:59
special URL that is used to do the streaming now let's see the test code
22:04
which is similar to the one before the difference is that you create the mock
22:09
and then run the two functions count to zero and stream in such a way as to see
22:14
if it works if I now go to the tests I run it you see that the test passes
22:20
because it is able to test a streamed code with a mock so now if I go to see
22:24
countdown I can now write three he does 2 1 0 we put 10 and it makes 9 8 7 it is
22:34
implementing the streamed and tested feature we put everything we've learned
22:39
into practice and create an LLM stream we have three exercises to do for the
22:45
first exercise look for to-do E2 one and here you have to add the parameters to
22:52
access and authorize Llama so see here the point where you need to complete the
22:56
code and to add the secrets then the second exercise is to fix the streaming
23:03
because if you watch the streaming feature at the moment it is written to
23:07
work with the countdown and does not handle the format that instead returns
23:12
Llama so you have to decode the object I return extract the part one I'm
23:18
interested in and estimate only that part the third exercise is to modify the
23:24
application which will be a chat that accesses the LLM in streaming and adds a
23:28
model switcher that is a command that allows you to change the model from
23:33
llama to deepsek and there is also a correction to be made because deepseek
23:38
produces a think that is not readable you need to make a modification so that
23:42
thing is readable by writing in square brackets and instead of staples now if
23:48
you want to try do it otherwise I will solve the exercises in the rest of the
23:52
video so exercise number one let's add the secrets so I'm going here here it is
24:00
the solution is obviously to add perm Ollama host and then we have to add here
24:07
off args get Ollama host args get off here right now as exercise says the result of
24:17
this change is that the test URL passes but the stream test does not so the URL
24:24
test before did not pass i forgot to run it it was red so much so that if we
24:29
deduce an error for example to see we put out one if I put this the test
24:36
breaks because you can't access Ollama if on the other hand it takes the right
24:41
parameter the test passes the streaming tests instead do not pass we have to
24:47
correct exercise two says to correct the streaming here it is fix streaming now
24:54
if you remember in this code we're accessing Ollama using the code we used
24:58
with an iterator what is produced at each step is no longer a simple 10 98
25:04
but is an object so what we have to do here is decode the object then I do deck
25:09
equals JSON loads which is the function that decodes a JSON object among other
25:16
things the streamer returns it to me like this so I have to transform it into
25:20
a string UTF8 decoder and I get an item that I have to extract response and by
25:28
default let's put error if it does not find it at this point I can return to
25:34
this deck and I can add to the final result this is what we have to do to
25:41
properly implement streaming when we access Ollama which returns to me that
25:45
sequence of objects that we only care about a part not everything so now the
25:50
streaming test should pass now I run the test stream and it passes here we have
25:56
corrected and we can deploy and now if we go here on the chat I say who are you
26:02
and here he is answering me in an exhausted way list the capitals of
26:07
United States here it is this is the list is giving it to me in streamed mode
26:14
now last finesse this is the third exercise test the model switch so now
26:20
simply let us to do e 2 three and let's add a if to manage the model switch so
26:29
if I write if in equals llama model equals llama and I change the input so
26:36
that it changes the model and makes it say who are you if the input is deepseek
26:42
the model is this and I make him say who are you so in this way I basically added
26:50
the functionality of switch of the models being able to change from llama
26:55
to deepsek and others if we want now we deploy always deoy also that I could do
27:01
it incrementally with devel and let's see the result now I'm going to
27:06
Pinocchio again calling the chat here now I write deepsek to him it is taking
27:12
a while because it is carrying out the change of model and therefore it is
27:16
loading the model here is if I write llama here now I change to llama here
27:23
what about slope okay do you see this empty space this blank space is actually
27:30
due to the fact that it says what it thinks but you can't see it so a
27:34
subtlety is going to modify this code and when I reverse engineer it I do so
27:39
if I ask what about China deepsek this changes deepseek tell me about the
27:46
meaning of life universe and everything baneing of life universe epic see that's
27:53
thinking sometimes it begins to think and does not come out anymore so it goes
27:58
into a loop however the execution it ends after a timeout that you can change
28:04
with the action parameters so usually it seems to me that it is 3 minutes and
28:09
after that he stops it when he begins to loop in his infinite thoughts and in
28:14
fact if he doesn't loop on a question of this kind I don't know what else can
28:18
send him into a loop here is his endless answer about life the universe and
28:23
everything else okay that's it because there is a limit that how can be changed
28:29
with the parameters of the duration of an execution for this reason it stopped
28:33
