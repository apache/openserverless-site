## Installation

### Overview

If you are in hurry and you think this guide is TL;DR (too long, donâ€™t
read), please read at least our [Quick Start](/docs/installation/quickstart/)
single page installation guide.

It gives you an overview of the installation process, omitting some more
advanced details. It can be enough to get you started and install
OpenServerless.

Once you want to know more, you can come back.

If you instead want the read the full documentation first, please read
on.

### Steps to follow

OpenServerless can be installed in many environments, using our powerful
command line interface `ops`.

So you should start downloading the CLI [from this
page](/docs/installation/download/index.adoc).

Once you installed `ops`, before installing you need to [check the
prerequisites](/docs/installation/prereq/index.adoc) for the installation, and satisfy
them

If the the prerequisites are OK, you can make your choices of what you
want to [Configure](/docs/installation/configure/) your OpenServerless
installation.

Finally, once you have:

1. downloaded `ops`

2. satisfied the prerequisites

3. configured your installation

you can choose where to install, either:

- in your [Local machine](/docs/installation/install/local/)

- in a [Linux server](/docs/installation/install/server/)

- in a [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/installation/install/cluster/)

### Post Installation

After the installation, you can change later the configuration and
update the system.
