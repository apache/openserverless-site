Download your version from this page, then install it according to the
procedures of your operating system.

### After the installation

Once installed, in the first run `ops` will tell to update the tasks
executing:

`ops -update`

This command updates the OpenServerless "tasks" (its internal logic) to the
latest version. This command should be also executed frequently, as the
tasks are continuously evolving and expanding.

`ops` will suggest when to update them (at least once a day).

You normally just need to update the tasks but sometimes you also need
to update `ops` itself. The system will detect when it is the case and
tell you what to do.
