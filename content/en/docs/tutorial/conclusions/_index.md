Summarizing what we have seen so far, in this tutorial we have seen how to:

1) set up an application;
2) create and publish the frontend
3) create and publish the backend, in the form of packages and actions;
4) interact with services using the `ops` utility;
5) publish the application and distribute it on test and production environments.

At this point, all you have to do is give space to your developer imagination and create your applications by taking advantage of the flexibility and scalability of Apache OpenServerless.
