## Tutorial

This tutorial walks you through developing a simple OpenServerless
application using the Command Line Interface (CLI) and Javascript (but
any supported language will do).

Its purpose is to showcase serverless development in action by creating
a contact form for a website. We will see the development process from
start to finish, including the deployment of the platform and running
the application.
