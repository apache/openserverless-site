[{"body":"Quick Start This is a quick start guide to the installation process, targeting experienced users in a hurry.\nIt provides a high-level overview of the installation process, omitting advanced of details. The missing pieces are covered in the rest of the documentation.\nOf course, if this guide is not enough and things fail, you can always apply the rule: “if everything fails, read the manual”.\nPrerequisites Start ensuring the prerequsites are satisfied:\nDownload and install ops, the OpenServerless CLI, picking version suitable for your environment. We support 64-bit versions of recent Windows, MacOS and major Linux distributions.\nCheck that ops is correctly installed: open the terminal and write:\nops -info\nConfigure the services you want to enable. By default, OpenServerless will install only the serverless engine, accessible in http with no services enabled.\nIf you want to enable all the services, use:\nops config enable --all otherwise pick the services you want, among --redis, --mongodb, --minio, --cron, --postgres. Note that --mongodb is actually FerretDB and requires Postgres which is implicitly also enabled. More details here.\nNow, choose where to install OpenServerless.\nYour options are:\nlocally in your workstation;\nin a Linux server in your intranet\nin a Linux server available on Internet\nin a Kubernetes cluster in your intranet\nin cloud, where you can provision a Kubernetes cluster\nLocal Installation If you have a decent workstation (with at least 16GB of memory) running a recent 64-bit operating system, you can install Docker Desktop and then install OpenServerless in it. Once you have:\ninstalled the CLI\nconfigured the services\ninstalled Docker Desktop\nMake sure Docker Desktop its running before the next operation. Install OpenServerless and its services in Docker with just this command:\nops setup devcluster Once it is installed, you can proceed to read the tutorial to learn how to code with it.\nNOTE: At least 16GB of memory is ideal, but if you know what you’re doing and can tolerate inefficiency, you can install with less using:\nexport PREFL_NO_MEM_CHECK=1 export PLEFL_NO_CPU_CHECK=1 Internet Server Configuration If you have access to a server on the Internet, you will know its IP address.\nMany cloud providers also give you a DNS name usually derived by the IP and very hard to remember such as ec2-12-34-56-78.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com.\nOnce you got the IP address and the DNS name, you can give to your server a bettername using a domain name provider. We cannot give here precise instructions as there are many DNS providers and each has different rules to do the setup. Check with your chosen domain name provider.\nIf you have this name, configure it and enable DNS with:\nops config apihost \u003cdns-name\u003e --tls=\u003cemail-address\u003e ❗ IMPORTANT\nReplace the \u003cdns-name\u003e with the actual DNS name, without using prefixes like http:// or suffixes like :443. Also, replace ` with your actual email address.\nthen proceed with the server installation.\nServer Installation Once you got access to a Linux server with:\nAn IP address or DNS name, referred to as \u003cserver\u003e\nPasswordless access with ssh to a Linux user \u003cuser\u003e\nAt least 8GB of memory and 50GB of disk space available\nThe user \u003cuser\u003e has passwordless sudo rights\nThe firewall that allows traffic to ports 80, 443 and 6443\nWithout any Docker or Kubernetes installed\nWithout any Web server or Web application installed\nthen you can install OpenServerless in it.\nThe server can be physical or virtual. We need Kubernetes in it but the installer takes care of installing also a flavor of Kubernetes, K3S, courtesy of K3Sup.\nTo install OpenServerless, first check you have access to the server with:\nssh \u003cuser\u003e@\u003cserver\u003e sudo hostname You should see no errors and read the internal hostname of your server.\nIf you do not receive errors, you can proceed to install OpenServerless with this command:\nops setup server \u003cserver\u003e \u003cuser\u003e ❗ IMPORTANT\nReplace in the commands \u003cserver\u003e with the address of your server, and \u003cuser\u003e with the actual user to use in your server. The \u003cserver\u003e can be the same as \u003cdns-name\u003e you have configured in the previous paragraph, if you did so, or simply the IP address of a server on your intranet.\nNow wait until the installation completes. Once it is installed, you can proceed to read the tutorial to learn how to code with it.\nCloud Cluster Provisioning If you have access to a cloud provider, you can set up a Kubernetes cluster in it. The Kubernetes cluster needs to satisfy certain prerequisites to be able to install OpenServerless with no issues.\nWe provide the support to easily configure and install a compliant Kubernetes cluster for the following clouds:\nAmazon AWS\nMicrosoft Azure\nGoogle Cloud\nAt the end of the installation you will have available and accessible a Kubernetes Cluster able to install OpenServerless, so proceed with a cluster installation.\nAmazon AWS Configure and install an Amazon EKS cluster on Amazon AWS with:\nops config eks ops cloud eks create then install the cluster.\nAzure AKS Configure and install an Azure AKS cluster on Microsoft Azure with:\nops config aks ops cloud aks create then install the cluster.\nGoogle Cloud GKE Configure and install a Google Cloud GKE with:\nops config gke ops cloud gke create then install the cluster.\nCluster Install In short, if you have access to kubernetes cluster, you can install OpenServerless with:\nops setup cluster For a slightly longer discussion, checking prerequisites before installing, read on.\nPrerequisites to install If you have access to a Kubernetes cluster with:\nAccess to the cluster-admin role\nBlock storage configured as the default storage class\nThe nginx-ingress installed\nKnowledge of the IP address of your nginx-ingress controller\nyou can install OpenServerless in it. You can read more details here.\nYou can get this access either by provisioning a Kubernetes cluster in cloud or getting access to it from your system administrator.\nWhatever the way you get access to your Kubernetes cluster, you will end up with a configuration file which is usually stored in a file named .kube/config in your home directory. This file will give access to the Kubernetes cluster to install OpenServerless.\nPerforming the installation To install, first, verify you have actually access to the Kubernetes cluster, by running this command:\nops debug kube info You should get information about your cluster, something like this:\nKubernetes control plane is running at \\https://api.nuvolaris.osh.n9s.cc:6443\nNow you can finally install OpenServerless with the command:\nops setup cluster Wait until the process is complete and if there are no errors, OpenServerless is installed and ready to go.\nOnce it is installed, you can proceed to read the Tutorial to learn how to code with it.\n","categories":"","description":"Fast path to install a self-hosted OpenServerless","excerpt":"Fast path to install a self-hosted OpenServerless","ref":"/docs/installation/quickstart/","tags":"","title":"Quick Start"},{"body":"Actions Actions are stateless functions that run on the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform. For example, an action can be used to detect the faces in an image, respond to a database change, respond to an API call, or post a Tweet. In general, an action is invoked in response to an event and produces some observable output.\nAn action may be created from a function programmed using a number of supported languages and runtimes, or from a binary-compatible executable.\nThe OpenServerless CLI makes it easy to create and invoke actions. Instructions for configuring and using the CLI are available here.\nYou can also use the REST API.\nWhile the actual function code will be specific to a language and runtime, the operations to create, invoke and manage an action are the same regardless of the implementation choice.\nWe recommend that you review the cli and read the tutorial before moving on to advanced topics.\nWhat you need to know about actions Functions should be stateless, or idempotent. While the system does not enforce this property, there is no guarantee that any state maintained by an action will be available across invocations. In some cases, deliberately leaking state across invocations may be advantageous for performance, but also exposes some risks.\nAn action executes in a sandboxed environment, namely a container. At any given time, a single activation will execute inside the container. Subsequent invocations of the same action may reuse a previous container, and there may exist more than one container at any given time, each having its own state.\nInvocations of an action are not ordered. If the user invokes an action twice from the command line or the REST API, the second invocation might run before the first. If the actions have side effects, they might be observed in any order.\nThere is no guarantee that actions will execute atomically. Two actions can run concurrently and their side effects can be interleaved. OpenWhisk and OpenServerless does not ensure any particular concurrent consistency model for side effects. Any concurrency side effects will be implementation-dependent.\nActions have two phases: an initialization phase, and a run phase. During initialization, the function is loaded and prepared for execution. The run phase receives the action parameters provided at invocation time. Initialization is skipped if an action is dispatched to a previously initialized container — this is referred to as a warm start. You can tell if an invocation was a warm activation or a cold one requiring initialization by inspecting the activation record.\nAn action runs for a bounded amount of time. This limit can be configured per action, and applies to both the initialization and the execution separately. If the action time limit is exceeded during the initialization or run phase, the activation’s response status is action developer error.\nAccessing action metadata within the action body The action environment contains several properties that are specific to the running action. These allow the action to programmatically work with OpenWhisk and OpenServerless assets via the REST API, or set an internal alarm when the action is about to use up its allotted time budget. The properties are accessible via the system environment for all supported runtimes: Node.js, Python, Swift, Java and Docker actions when using the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless Docker skeleton.\n__OW_API_HOST the API host for the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless deployment running this action.\n__OW_API_KEY the API key for the subject invoking the action, this key may be a restricted API key. This property is absent unless requested with the annotation explicitly provide-api-key\n__OW_NAMESPACE the namespace for the activation (this may not be the same as the namespace for the action).\n__OW_ACTION_NAME the fully qualified name of the running action.\n__OW_ACTION_VERSION the internal version number of the running action.\n__OW_ACTIVATION_ID the activation id for this running action instance.\n__OW_DEADLINE the approximate time when this action will have consumed its entire duration quota (measured in epoch milliseconds).\n","categories":"","description":"What Actions are and how to create and execute them","excerpt":"What Actions are and how to create and execute them","ref":"/docs/reference/entities/actions/","tags":"","title":"Actions"},{"body":"OpenServerless Cli OpenServerless offers a powerful command line interface named ops which extends and embeds the OpenWhisk wsk.\nDownload instructions are available here.\nLet’s see some advanced uses of ops.\nOpenServerless access is usually configured logging into the platform with the ops -login command.\nYou can also configure access directly using the ops -wsk command.\nThere are two required properties to configure:\nAPI host (name or IP address) for the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless deployment you want to use.\nAuthorization key (username and password) which grants you access to the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless API.\nThe API host is the installation host, the one you configure in installation with ops config apihost\nops -wsk property set --apihost \u003copenwhisk_baseurl\u003e If you know your authorization key, you can configure the CLI to use it. Otherwise, you will need to obtain an authorization key for most CLI operations. The API key is visible in the file ~/.wskprops after you perform a ops -login. This file can be sourced to be read as environment variables.\nsource ~/.wskprops ops -wsk property set --auth $AUTH Tip: The OpenWhisk and OpenServerless CLI stores properties in the ~/.wskprops configuration file by default. The location of this file can be altered by setting the WSK_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.\nThe required properties described above have the following keys in the .wskprops file:\nAPIHOST - Required key for the API host value.\nAUTH - Required key for the Authorization key.\nTo verify your CLI setup, try ops action list.\nConfigure the CLI to use an HTTPS proxy The CLI can be setup to use an HTTPS proxy. To setup an HTTPS proxy, an environment variable called HTTPS_PROXY must be created. The variable must be set to the address of the HTTPS proxy, and its port using the following format: {PROXY IP}:{PROXY PORT}.\nConfigure the CLI to use client certificate The CLI has an extra level of security from client to apihost, system provides default client certificate configuration which deployment process generated, then you can refer to below steps to use client certificate:\nops -wsk property set --cert \u003cclient_cert_path\u003e --key \u003cclient_key_path\u003e ","categories":"","description":"How to use the advanced features of ops command line","excerpt":"How to use the advanced features of ops command line","ref":"/docs/reference/references/advanced-cli/","tags":"","title":"Advanced CLI"},{"body":"Contribution Guidelines Subscribe our mailing list sending an email to dev-subscribe@openserverless.apache.org Discuss your contribution and get a ticket assigned in our Issue Tracker setup your virtual machine as described here .

You can also a REST API crafted explicitly for OpenServerless.\nThe entities available in OpenServerless are:\nPackages: They serve as a means of grouping actions together, facilitating the sharing of parameters, annotations, etc. Additionally, they offer a base URL that can be utilized by web applications.\nActions: These are the fundamental components of a OpenServerless application, capable of being written in any programming language. Actions accept input and produce output, both formatted in JSON.\nActivations: Each action invocations produces an activation id that can be listed. Action output and results logged and are associated to activations and can be retrieved providing an activativation id.\nSequences: Actions can be interconnected, where the output of one action serves as the input for another, effectively forming a sequence.\nTriggers: Serving as entry points with distinct names, triggers are instrumental in activating multiple actions.\nRules: Rules establish an association between a trigger and an action. Consequently, when a trigger is fired, all associated actions are invoked accordingly.\nThe ops command Let’s now provide an overview of OpenServerless’ command line interface, focusing on the ops command.\nThe command can be dowloaded in precompile binary format for many platform following the Download button on https://www.nuvolaris.io/\nThe ops command is composed of many commands, each one with many subcommands. The general format is:\nops \u003centity\u003e \u003ccommand\u003e \u003cparameters\u003e \u003cflags\u003e Note that \u003cparameters\u003e and \u003cflags\u003e are different for each \u003ccommand\u003e, and for each \u003centity\u003e there are many subcommands.\nThe CLI shows documention in the form of help output if you do not provide enough parameters to it. Start with ops to get the list of the main commands. If you type the ops \u003centity\u003e get the help for that entity, and so on.\nFor example, let’s see ops output (showing the command) and the more frequently used command, action, also showing the more common subcommands, shared with many others:\n$ ops Welcome to Ops, the all-mighty OpenServerless Build Tool The top level commands all have subcommands. Just type ops \u003ccommand\u003e to see its subcommands. Commands: action work with actions activation work with activations invoke shorthand for action invoke (-r is the default) logs shorthand for activation logs package work with packages result shorthand for activation result rule work with rules trigger work with triggers url get the url of a web action$ wsk action There are many more sub commands used for aministrative purposes. In this documentation we only focus on the subcommands used to manage the main entities of OpenServerless.\nKeep in mind that commands represent entities, and their subcommands follow the CRUD model (Create, Retrieve via get/list, Update, Delete). This serves as a helpful mnemonic to understand the ops command’s functionality. While there are exceptions, these will be addressed throughout the chapter’s discussion. Note however that some subcommand may have some specific flags.\nNaming Entities Let’s see how entities are named.\nEach user also has a namespace, and everything a user creates, belongs to it.\nThe namespace is usually created by a system administrator.\nUnder a namespace you can create triggers, rules, actions and packages.\nThose entities will have a name like this:\n/mirella/demo-triggger\n/mirella/demo-rule\n/mirella/demo-package\n/mirella/demo-action\nWhen you create a package, you can put under it actions and feeds. Those entities are named\n/mirella/demo-package/demo-action\n/mirella/demo-package/demo-feed\n💡 NOTE\nIn the commands you do not require to specify a namespace. If your user is mirella, your namespace is /mirella, and You type demo-package to mean /mirella/demo-package, and demo-package/demo-action to mean /mirella/demo-package/demo-action.\n","categories":"","description":"The parts that OpenServerless applications are made of","excerpt":"The parts that OpenServerless applications are made of","ref":"/docs/cli/entities/","tags":"","title":"Entities"},{"body":"In this section you can find more informations about OpenServerless and OpenWhisk entities.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"In this section you can find more informations about OpenServerless …","ref":"/docs/reference/entities/","tags":"","title":"Entities"},{"body":"Getting started Build a sample Application Imagine we have a static website and need server logic to store contacts and validate data. This would require a server, a database and some code to glue it all together. With a serverless approach, we can just sprinkle little functions (that we call actions) on top of our static website and let OpenServerless take care of the rest. No more setting up VMs, backend web servers, databases, etc.\nIn this tutorial, we will see how you can take advantage of several services which are already part of a OpenServerless deployment and develop a contact form page for users to fill it with their emails and messages, which are then sent via email to us and stored in a database.\nFinally, we’ll see how to activate external services using Web hooks.\nOpenserverless CLI: Ops Serverless development is mostly performed on the CLI, and OpenServerless has its tool called ops. It’s a command line tool that allows you to deploy (and interact with) the platform seamlessly to the cloud, locally and in custom environments.\nOps is cross-platform and can be installed on Windows, Linux and MacOS. You can find the project and the sources on Apache OpenServerless Cli Github page\nDeploy OpenServerless To start using OpenServerless you can refer to the Installation Guide. You can follow the local installation to quickly get started with OpenServerless deployed on your machine, or if you want to follow the tutorial on a deployment on cloud you can pick one of the many supported cloud provider. Once installed come back here!\nEnabling Services After installing OpenServerless on a local machine with Docker or on a supported cloud, you can enable or disable the services offered by the platform. As we will use Postgres database, the Static content with the Minio S3 compatible storage, let’s run in the terminal:\nops config enable --postgres --static --minio --cron This is the default set of services.\nSince you should already have a deployment running, we have to update it with the new services so they get deployed.

However if you have access to the server, the information of which user to use should have been provided, including a way to access to the root user.\nYou need to give this user the right to execute commands as root without a password, and you do this by configuring the command sudo.\nYou usually have either access to root with the su command, or you can execute sudo with a password.\nType either su or sudo bash to become root and edit the file /etc/sudoers adding the following line:\n\u003cuser\u003e ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL where \u003cuser\u003e is the user you use to log into the system.\nOpen the firewall You need to open the following ports in the firewall of the server:\n443 for HTTPS\n80 for HTTP and provisioning certificates\n6443 (K3S) or 16443 (MicroK8S) for Kubernetes\nFor information on how to open the firewall, please consult the documentation of your cloud provider or contact your system administrator, as there are no common procedures and they depends on the cloud provider.\n","categories":"","description":"General prerequisites to install OpenServerless","excerpt":"General prerequisites to install OpenServerless","ref":"/docs/installation/prereq/server/generic/","tags":"","title":"SSH and Sudo"},{"body":"Tutorial This tutorial walks you through developing a simple OpenServerless application using the Command Line Interface (CLI) and Javascript (but any supported language will do).\nIts purpose is to showcase serverless development in action by creating a contact form for a website. We will see the development process from start to finish, including the deployment of the platform and running the application.\n","categories":"","description":"Showcase serverless development in action","excerpt":"Showcase serverless development in action","ref":"/docs/tutorial/","tags":"","title":"Tutorial"},{"body":"Actions An action can generally be considered as a function, a snippet of code, or generally a method.\nThe ops action command is designed for managing actions, featuring frequently utilized CRUD operations such as list, create, update, and delete. We will illustrate these operations through examples using a basic hello action. Let’s assume we have the following file in the current directory:\nThe hello.js script with the following content:\nfunction main(args) { return { body: \"Hello\" } } Simple Action Deployment If we want to deploy this simple action in the package demo, let’s execute:\n$ ops package update demo ok: updated package demo $ ops action update demo/hello hello.js ok: update action demo/hello Note that we ensured the package exists before creating the action.\nWe can actually omit the package name. In this case, the package name is default, which always exists in a namespace. However, we advise always placing actions in some named package.\n💡 NOTE\nWe used update, but we could have used create if the action does not exist because update also creates the action if it does not exist and updates it if it is already there. Update here is similar to the patch concept in REST API. However, create generates an error if an action does not exist, while update does not, so it is practical to always use update instead of create (unless we really want an error for an existing action for some reason).\nHow to Invoke Actions Let’s try to run the action:\n$ ops invoke demo/hello { \"body\": \"Hello\" } Actually, the invoke command does not exist, or better, it’s just a handy shortcut for ops action invoke -r.\nIf you try to run ops action invoke demo/hello, you get:\n$ ops action invoke demo/hello ok: invoked /_/demo/hello with id fec047bc81ff40bc8047bc81ff10bc85 You may wonder where the result is. In reality, in OpenServerless, all actions are by default asynchronous, so what you usually get is the activation id to retrieve the result once the action is completed.\nTo block the execution until the action is completed and get the result, you can either use the flag -r or --result, or use ops invoke.\nNote, however, that we are using ops to invoke an action, which means all the requests are authenticated. You cannot invoke actions directly without logging into the system first.\nHowever, you can mark an action to be public by creating it with --web true (see below).\nPublic Actions If you want an action to be public, you can do:\n$ ops action update demo/hello hello.js --web true ok: updated action demo/hello $ ops url demo/hello https://nuvolaris.dev/api/v1/web/mirella/demo/hello and you can invoke it with:\n$ curl -sL https://nuvolaris.dev/api/v1/web/dashboard/demo/hello Hello Note that the output is only showing the value of the body field. This is because the web actions must follow a pattern to produce an output suitable for web output, so the output should be under the key body, and so on. Check the section on Web Actions for more information.\n💡 NOTE\nActually, ops url is a shortcut for ops action get --url. You can use ops action get to retrieve a more detailed description of an action in JSON format.\nAfter action create, action update, and action get (and the shortcuts invoke and url), we should mention action list and action delete.\nThe action list command obviously lists actions and allows us to delete them:\n$ ops action list /mirella/demo/hello private nodejs:18 $ ops action delete demo/hello ok: deleted action demo/hello Conclusion Actions are a core part of our entities. A ops action is a self-contained and executable unit of code deployed on the ops serverless computing platform.\n","categories":"","description":"Functions, the core of OpenServerless","excerpt":"Functions, the core of OpenServerless","ref":"/docs/cli/entities/actions/","tags":"","title":"Actions"},{"body":"Administration If you are the administrator and you have access to the Kubernetes cluster where OpenServerless is installed you can administer the system.\nYou have access to the ops admin subcommand with the following synopsis:\nSubcommand: ops admin\nUsage: admin adduser \u003cusername\u003e \u003cemail\u003e \u003cpassword\u003e [--all] [--redis] [--mongodb] [--minio] [--postgres] [--storagequota=\u003cquota\u003e|auto] admin deleteuser \u003cusername\u003e Commands: admin adduser create a new user in OpenServerless with the username, email and password provided admin deleteuser delete a user from the OpenServerless installation via the username provided Options: --all enable all services --redis enable redis --mongodb enable mongodb --minio enable minio --postgres enable postgres --storagequota=\u003cquota\u003e ","categories":"","description":"System administration","excerpt":"System administration","ref":"/docs/cli/admin/","tags":"","title":"Administration"},{"body":"About Apache OpenServerless Apache OpenServerless is an Open Source project, released under the Apache License 2.0 providing a portable and complete Serverless environment, allowing to build quickly and easily cloud-native applications.\nOur goal is to make OpenServerless ubitiquous, allowing it to easily run a complete and portable environment that runs in every Kubernetes.\nOpenServerless is based on Apache OpenWhisk, which provides a powerful, production-ready serverless engine.\nHowever, the serverless engine is just the beginning, because a serverless environment requires a set of integrated services.\nOpenServerless provides integrated with OpenWhisk several additional services such as databases, object storage, and a cron scheduler.\nFurthermore, we test it on many public cloud Kubernetes services and on-premises Kubernetes vendors.\nThe platform is paired with a powerful CLI tool, ops, which lets you deploy OpenServerless quickly and easily everywhere, and perform a lot of development tasks.\nOur goal is to build a complete distribution of a serverless environment with the following features:\nIt is easy to install and manage.\nIntegrates all the key services to build applications.\nIt is as portable as possible to run potentially in every Kubernetes.\nIt is however tested regularly against a set of supported Kubernetes environments.\nIf you want to know more about our goals, check our roadmap document.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"About Apache OpenServerless Apache OpenServerless is an Open Source …","ref":"/docs/","tags":"","title":"Docs"},{"body":"First steps Starting at the Front Right now, after a fresh installation, and after added the opstutorial user, if we visit the \u003capihost\u003e you will see a very simple page with:\nWelcome to Nuvolaris static content distributor landing page!!!\nThat’s because we’ve activated the static content, and by default it starts with this simple index.html page.

This allows you to program backend logic which your web application can access anonymously without requiring an OpenWhisk and OpenServerless authentication key. It is up to the action developer to implement their own desired authentication and authorization (i.e.OAuth flow).\nWeb action activations will be associated with the user that created the action. This actions defers the cost of an action activation from the caller to the owner of the action.\nLet’s take the following JavaScript action hello.js,\n$ cat hello.js function main({name}) { var msg = 'you did not tell me who you are.'; if (name) { msg = `hello ${name}!` } return {body: `\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003ch3\u003e${msg}\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e`} } You may create a web action hello in the package demo for the namespace guest using the CLI’s --web flag with a value of true or yes:\n$ ops package create demo ok: created package demo $ ops action create demo/hello hello.js --web true ok: created action demo/hello $ ops action get demo/hello --url ok: got action hello https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello Using the --web flag with a value of true or yes allows an action to be accessible via REST interface without the need for credentials. A web action can be invoked using a URL that is structured as follows:\nhttps://{APIHOST}/api/v1/web/{QUALIFIED ACTION NAME}.{EXT}` The fully qualified name of an action consists of three parts: the namespace, the package name, and the action name.\nThe fully qualified name of the action must include its package name, which is default if the action is not in a named package.\nAn example is guest/demo/hello. The last part of the URI called the extension which is typically .http although other values are permitted as described later. The web action API path may be used with curl or wget without an API key. It may even be entered directly in your browser.\nTry opening:\nhttps://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello.http?name=Jane in your web browser. Or try invoking the action via curl:\ncurl https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello.http?name=Jane Here is an example of a web action that performs an HTTP redirect:\nfunction main() { return { headers: { location: 'http://openwhisk.org' }, statusCode: 302 } } Or sets a cookie:\nfunction main() { return { headers: { 'Set-Cookie': 'UserID=Jane; Max-Age=3600; Version=', 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }, statusCode: 200, body: '\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003ch3\u003ehello\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e' } } Or sets multiple cookies:\nfunction main() { return { headers: { 'Set-Cookie': [ 'UserID=Jane; Max-Age=3600; Version=', 'SessionID=asdfgh123456; Path = /' ], 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }, statusCode: 200, body: '\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003ch3\u003ehello\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e' } } Or returns an image/png:\nfunction main() { let png = \u003cbase 64 encoded string\u003e return { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'image/png' }, statusCode: 200, body: png }; } Or returns application/json:\nfunction main(params) { return { statusCode: 200, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: params }; } The default content-type for an HTTP response is application/json and the body may be any allowed JSON value. The default content-type may be omitted from the headers.\nIt is important to be aware of the response size limit for actions since a response that exceeds the predefined system limits will fail. Large objects should not be sent inline through OpenWhisk and OpenServerless, but instead deferred to an object store, for example.\nHandling HTTP requests with actions An OpenWhisk and OpenServerless action that is not a web action requires both authentication and must respond with a JSON object. In contrast, web actions may be invoked without authentication, and may be used to implement HTTP handlers that respond with headers, statusCode, and body content of different types. The web action must still return a JSON object, but the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless system (namely the controller) will treat a web action differently if its result includes one or more of the following as top level JSON properties:\nheaders: a JSON object where the keys are header-names and the values are string, number, or boolean values for those headers (default is no headers). To send multiple values for a single header, the header’s value should be a JSON array of values.\nstatusCode: a valid HTTP status code (default is 200 OK if body is not empty otherwise 204 No Content).\nbody: a string which is either plain text, JSON object or array, or a base64 encoded string for binary data (default is empty response).\nThe body is considered empty if it is null, the empty string \"\" or undefined.\nThe controller will pass along the action-specified headers, if any, to the HTTP client when terminating the request/response. Similarly the controller will respond with the given status code when present. Lastly, the body is passed along as the body of the response. If a content-type header is not declared in the action result’s headers, the body is interpreted as application/json for non-string values, and text/html otherwise. When the content-type is defined, the controller will determine if the response is binary data or plain text and decode the string using a base64 decoder as needed. Should the body fail to decoded correctly, an error is returned to the caller.\nHTTP Context All web actions, when invoked, receives additional HTTP request details as parameters to the action input argument. They are:\n__ow_method (type: string): the HTTP method of the request.\n__ow_headers (type: map string to string): the request headers.\n__ow_path (type: string): the unmatched path of the request (matching stops after consuming the action extension).\n__ow_user (type: string): the namespace identifying the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless authenticated subject.\n__ow_body (type: string): the request body entity, as a base64 encoded string when content is binary or JSON object/array, or plain string otherwise.\n__ow_query (type: string): the query parameters from the request as an unparsed string.\nA request may not override any of the named __ow_ parameters above; doing so will result in a failed request with status equal to 400 Bad Request.\nThe __ow_user is only present when the web action is annotated to require authentication and allows a web action to implement its own authorization policy. The __ow_query is available only when a web action elects to handle the “raw” HTTP request. It is a string containing the query parameters parsed from the URI (separated by \u0026). The __ow_body property is present either when handling “raw” HTTP requests, or when the HTTP request entity is not a JSON object or form data. Web actions otherwise receive query and body parameters as first class properties in the action arguments with body parameters taking precedence over query parameters, which in turn take precedence over action and package parameters.\nAdditional features Web actions bring some additional features that include:\nContent extensions: the request must specify its desired content type as one of.json,.html,.http, .svg or .text. This is done by adding an extension to the action name in the URI, so that an action /guest/demo/hello is referenced as /guest/demo/hello.http for example to receive an HTTP response back. For convenience, the .http extension is assumed when no extension is detected.\nQuery and body parameters as input: the action receives query parameters as well as parameters in the request body. The precedence order for merging parameters is: package parameters, binding parameters, action parameters, query parameter, body parameters with each of these overriding any previous values in case of overlap . As an example /guest/demo/hello.http?name=Jane will pass the argument {name: \"Jane\"} to the action.\nForm data: in addition to the standard application/json, web actions may receive URL encoded from data application/x-www-form-urlencoded data as input.\nActivation via multiple HTTP verbs: a web action may be invoked via any of these HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, as well as HEAD and OPTIONS.\nNon JSON body and raw HTTP entity handling: A web action may accept an HTTP request body other than a JSON object, and may elect to always receive such values as opaque values (plain text when not binary, or base64 encoded string otherwise).\nThe example below briefly sketches how you might use these features in a web action. Consider an action /guest/demo/hello with the following body:\nfunction main(params) { return { response: params }; } This is an example of invoking the web action using the .json extension, indicating a JSON response.\n$ curl https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello.json { \"response\": { \"__ow_method\": \"get\", \"__ow_headers\": { \"accept\": \"*/*\", \"connection\": \"close\", \"host\": \"172.17.0.1\", \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.43.0\" }, \"__ow_path\": \"\" } } You can supply query parameters.\n$ curl https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello.json?name=Jane { \"response\": { \"name\": \"Jane\", \"__ow_method\": \"get\", \"__ow_headers\": { \"accept\": \"*/*\", \"connection\": \"close\", \"host\": \"172.17.0.1\", \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.43.0\" }, \"__ow_path\": \"\" } } You may use form data as input.\n$ curl https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello.json -d \"name\":\"Jane\" { \"response\": { \"name\": \"Jane\", \"__ow_method\": \"post\", \"__ow_headers\": { \"accept\": \"*/*\", \"connection\": \"close\", \"content-length\": \"10\", \"content-type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"host\": \"172.17.0.1\", \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.43.0\" }, \"__ow_path\": \"\" } } You may also invoke the action with a JSON object.\n$ curl https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello.json -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"name\":\"Jane\"}' { \"response\": { \"name\": \"Jane\", \"__ow_method\": \"post\", \"__ow_headers\": { \"accept\": \"*/*\", \"connection\": \"close\", \"content-length\": \"15\", \"content-type\": \"application/json\", \"host\": \"172.17.0.1\", \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.43.0\" }, \"__ow_path\": \"\" } } You see above that for convenience, query parameters, form data, and JSON object body entities are all treated as dictionaries, and their values are directly accessible as action input properties. This is not the case for web actions which opt to instead handle HTTP request entities more directly, or when the web action receives an entity that is not a JSON object.\nHere is an example of using a “text” content-type with the same example shown above.\n$ curl https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello.json -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d \"Jane\" { \"response\": { \"__ow_method\": \"post\", \"__ow_headers\": { \"accept\": \"*/*\", \"connection\": \"close\", \"content-length\": \"4\", \"content-type\": \"text/plain\", \"host\": \"172.17.0.1\", \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.43.0\" }, \"__ow_path\": \"\", \"__ow_body\": \"Jane\" } } Content extensions A content extension is generally required when invoking a web action; the absence of an extension assumes .http as the default. The fully qualified name of the action must include its package name, which is default if the action is not in a named package.\nProtected parameters Action parameters are protected and treated as immutable. Parameters are automatically finalized when enabling web actions.\n$ ops action create /guest/demo/hello hello.js \\ --parameter name Jane \\ --web true The result of these changes is that the name is bound to Jane and may not be overridden by query or body parameters because of the final annotation. This secures the action against query or body parameters that try to change this value whether by accident or intentionally.\nSecuring web actions By default, a web action can be invoked by anyone having the web action’s invocation URL. Use the require-whisk-auth web action annotation to secure the web action. When the require-whisk-auth annotation is set to true, the action will authenticate the invocation request’s Basic Authorization credentials to confirm they represent a valid OpenWhisk and OpenServerless identity. When set to a number or a case-sensitive string, the action’s invocation request must include a X-Require-Whisk-Auth header having this same value. Secured web actions will return a Not Authorized when credential validation fails.\nAlternatively, use the --web-secure flag to automatically set the require-whisk-auth annotation. When set to true a random number is generated as the require-whisk-auth annotation value. When set to false the require-whisk-auth annotation is removed. When set to any other value, that value is used as the require-whisk-auth annotation value.\nops action update /guest/demo/hello hello.js --web true --web-secure my-secret or\nops action update /guest/demo/hello hello.js --web true -a require-whisk-auth my-secret curl https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello.json?name=Jane -X GET -H \"X-Require-Whisk-Auth: my-secret\" It’s important to note that the owner of the web action owns all of the web action’s activations records and will incur the cost of running the action in the system regardless of how the action was invoked.\nDisabling web actions To disable a web action from being invoked via web API (https://APIHOST/api/v1/web/), pass a value of false or no to the --web flag while updating an action with the CLI.\nops action update /guest/demo/hello hello.js --web false Raw HTTP handling A web action may elect to interpret and process an incoming HTTP body directly, without the promotion of a JSON object to first class properties available to the action input (e.g., args.name vs parsing args.__ow_query). This is done via a raw-http annotation. Using the same example show earlier, but now as a “raw” HTTP web action receiving name both as a query parameters and as JSON value in the HTTP request body:\n$ curl https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/demo/hello.json?name=Jane -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"name\":\"Jane\"}' { \"response\": { \"__ow_method\": \"post\", \"__ow_query\": \"name=Jane\", \"__ow_body\": \"eyJuYW1lIjoiSmFuZSJ9\", \"__ow_headers\": { \"accept\": \"*/*\", \"connection\": \"close\", \"content-length\": \"15\", \"content-type\": \"application/json\", \"host\": \"172.17.0.1\", \"user-agent\": \"curl/7.43.0\" }, \"__ow_path\": \"\" } } Enabling raw HTTP handling Raw HTTP web actions are enabled via the --web flag using a value of raw.\nops action create /guest/demo/hello hello.js --web raw Disabling raw HTTP handling Disabling raw HTTP can be accomplished by passing a value of false or no to the --web flag.\nops update create /guest/demo/hello hello.js --web false Decoding binary body content from Base64 When using raw HTTP handling, the __ow_body content will be encoded in Base64 when the request content-type is binary. Below are functions demonstrating how to decode the body content in Node, Python, and PHP. Simply save a method shown below to file, create a raw HTTP web action utilizing the saved artifact, and invoke the web action.\nNode function main(args) { decoded = new Buffer(args.__ow_body, 'base64').toString('utf-8') return {body: decoded} } Python def main(args): try: decoded = args['__ow_body'].decode('base64').strip() return {\"body\": decoded} except: return {\"body\": \"Could not decode body from Base64.\"} PHP \u003c?php function main(array $args) : array { $decoded = base64_decode($args['__ow_body']); return [\"body\" =\u003e $decoded]; } As an example, save the Node function as decode.js and execute the following commands:\n$ ops action create decode decode.js --web raw ok: created action decode $ curl -k -H \"content-type: application\" -X POST -d \"Decoded body\" https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/default/decodeNode.json { \"body\": \"Decoded body\" } Options Requests By default, an OPTIONS request made to a web action will result in CORS headers being automatically added to the response headers. These headers allow all origins and the options, get, delete, post, put, head, and patch HTTP verbs. In addition, the header Access-Control-Request-Headers is echoed back as the header Access-Control-Allow-Headers if it is present in the HTTP request. Otherwise, a default value is generated as shown below.\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, DELETE, POST, PUT, HEAD, PATCH Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, User-Agent Alternatively, OPTIONS requests can be handled manually by a web action. To enable this option add a web-custom-options annotation with a value of true to a web action. When this feature is enabled, CORS headers will not automatically be added to the request response. Instead, it is the developer’s responsibility to append their desired headers programmatically. Below is an example of creating custom responses to OPTIONS requests.\nfunction main(params) { if (params.__ow_method == \"options\") { return { headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'OPTIONS, GET', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'example.com' }, statusCode: 200 } } } Save the above function to custom-options.js and execute the following commands:\n$ ops action create custom-option custom-options.js --web true -a web-custom-options true $ curl https://${APIHOST}/api/v1/web/guest/default/custom-options.http -kvX OPTIONS \u003c HTTP/1.1 200 OK \u003c Server: nginx/1.11.13 \u003c Content-Length: 0 \u003c Connection: keep-alive \u003c Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET \u003c Access-Control-Allow-Origin: example.com Web Actions in Shared Packages A web action in a shared (i.e., public) package is accessible as a web action either directly via the package’s fully qualified name, or via a package binding. It is important to note that a web action in a public package will be accessible for all bindings of the package even if the binding is private. This is because the web action annotation is carried on the action and cannot be overridden. If you do not wish to expose a web action through your package bindings, then you should clone-and-own the package instead.\nAction parameters are inherited from its package, and the binding if there is one. You can make package parameters immutable by defining their values through a package binding.\nError Handling When an OpenWhisk and OpenServerless action fails, there are two different failure modes. The first is known as an application error and is analogous to a caught exception: the action returns a JSON object containing a top level error property. The second is a developer error which occurs when the action fails catastrophically and does not produce a response (this is similar to an uncaught exception). For web actions, the controller handles application errors as follows:\nThe controller projects an error property from the response object.\nThe controller applies the content handling implied by the action extension to the value of the error property.\nDevelopers should be aware of how web actions might be used and generate error responses accordingly. For example, a web action that is used with the .http extension should return an HTTP response, for example: {error: { statusCode: 400 }. Failing to do so will in a mismatch between the implied content-type from the extension and the action content-type in the error response. Special consideration must be given to web actions that are sequences, so that components that make up a sequence can generate adequate errors when necessary.\n","categories":"","description":"Actions annotated to quickly build web based applications","excerpt":"Actions annotated to quickly build web based applications","ref":"/docs/reference/entities/webactions/","tags":"","title":"Web Actions"},{"body":"Activations When an event occurs that triggers a function, ops creates an activation record, which contains information about the function execution, such as input parameters, output results, and any metadata associated with the activation.

To make it work let’s start to fill our package directory with backend actions.\nForm validation We well start to handle the form submission. We can do that by adding a new action that will be called when the form is submitted. Let’s create a submit.js file inside our packages/contact folder.\nYou directory structure should looks like this:\ncontact_us_app ├── packages │ └── contact │ └── submit.js └── web └── index.html Paste this content inside the submit.js file:\n//--web true //--kind nodejs:default function main(args) { let message = []; let errors = []; // TODO: Add here Form Validation code // TODO: Add here the code for returning the Result } This action is a bit more complex. It takes the input object (called args) which will contain the form data (accessible via args.name, args.email, etc.). With that. we will do some validation and then return the result.\n💡 NOTE\nYou may have noticed the strange comments at the beginning of the file. Those comments are used by ops ide to automatically handle the publishing of files by calling ops package or ops action as needed. In particular:\nthe --web true will enable this as a web action; --kind nodejs:default will ask OpenServerless to run this code on the nodejs default runtime. Validation Let’s start filling out the “Form Validation” part by checking the name:\n// validate the name if (args.name) { message.push(\"name: \" + args.name); } else { errors.push(\"No name provided\"); } Then the email by using a regular expression:\n// validate the email var re = /\\S+@\\S+\\.\\S+/; if (args.email \u0026\u0026 re.test(args.email)) { message.push(\"email: \" + args.email); } else { errors.push(\"Email missing or incorrect.\"); } The phone, by checking that it’s at least 10 digits:\n// validate the phone if (args.phone \u0026\u0026 args.phone.match(/\\d/g).length \u003e= 10) { message.push(\"phone: \" + args.phone); } else { errors.push(\"Phone number missing or incorrect.\"); } Finally, the message text, if present:\n// validate the message if (args.message) { message.push(\"message:\" + args.message); } Submission With the validation phase, we added to the “errors” array all the errors we found, and to the “message” array all the data we want to show to the user. So if there are errors, we have to show them, otherwise, we store the message and return a “thank you” page.\n// return the result if (errors.length) { var errs = \"\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\" + errors.join(\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\") + \"\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\"; return { body: \"\u003ch1\u003eErrors!\u003c/h1\u003e\" + errs + '\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"javascript:window.history.back()\"\u003eBack\u003c/a\u003e' }; } else { var data = \"\u003cpre\u003e\" + message.join(\"\\n\") + \"\u003c/pre\u003e\"; return { body: \"\u003ch1\u003eThank you!\u003c/h1\u003e\" + data, name: args.name, email: args.email, phone: args.phone, message: args.message }; } Note how this action is returning HTML code. Actions can return a { body: \u003chtml\u003e } kind of response and have their own url so they can be invoked via a browser and display some content.\nThe HTML code to display is always returned in the body field, but we can also return other stuff. In this case we added a a field for each of the form fields. This gives us the possibility to invoke in a sequence another action that can act just on those fields to store the data in the database.\nLet’s start deploying the action:\nops ide deploy You should see output like this:\n/home/openserverless/.ops/tmp/deploy.pid PID 70925 \u003e Scan: \u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/submit.js \u003e Deploying: \u003e\u003e Package: contact $ $OPS package update contact ok: updated package contact \u003e\u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/submit.js $ $OPS action update contact/submit packages/contact/submit.js --web true --kind python:default --param POSTGRES_URL $POSTGRES_URL ok: updated action contact/submit build process exited with code 0 UPLOAD ASSETS FROM web ==================| UPLOAD RESULTS |================== | FILES : 1 | COMPLETED : 1 | ERRORS : 0 | SKIPPED : 0 | EXEC.

This is meant to be used via the contact form page!\nWe need to wire it into the index.html. So let’s open it again and add a couple of attributes to the form. Change the \u003cform\u003e tag as follow:\n\u003cform method=\"POST\" action=\"/api/v1/web/opstutorial/contact/submit\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\u003e Upload the web folder again with the new changes:\nops ide deploy Now if you go to the contact form page the send button should work. It will invoke the submit action which in turn will return some html.\nIf you fill it correctly, you should see the “Thank you” page.\nNote how only the HTML from the body field is displayed, the other fields are ignored in this case.\nThe ops action command can be used for many more things besides creating actions. For example, you can use it to list all available actions:\nops action list actions /opstutorial/contact/submit private nodejs:21 And you can also get info on a specific action:\nops action get contact/submit ok: got action contact/submit { \"namespace\": \"opstutorial/contact\", \"name\": \"submit\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"exec\": { \"kind\": \"nodejs:21\", \"binary\": false }, \"annotations\": [ { \"key\": \"web-export\", \"value\": true }, { \"key\": \"raw-http\", \"value\": false }, { \"key\": \"final\", \"value\": true }, { \"key\": \"provide-api-key\", \"value\": false }, { \"key\": \"exec\", \"value\": \"nodejs:21\" } ], \"parameters\": [ { \"key\": \"POSTGRES_URL\", \"value\": \"postgresql://opstutorial:\u003cpassword\u003e@nuvolaris-postgres.nuvolaris.svc.cluster.local:5432/opstutorial\" } ], ... } These commands can come in handy when you need to debug your actions.\nHere is the complete the submit.js action:\n//--web true //--kind nodejs:default function main(args) { let message = []; let errors = []; // validate the name if (args.name) { message.push(\"name: \" + args.name) } else { errors.push(\"No name provided\") } // validate the email var re = /\\S+@\\S+\\.\\S+/; if (args.email \u0026\u0026 re.test(args.email)) { message.push(\"email: \" + args.email); } else { errors.push(\"Email missing or incorrect.\"); } // validate the phone if (args.phone \u0026\u0026 args.phone.match(/\\d/g).length \u003e= 10) { message.push(\"phone: \" + args.phone); } else { errors.push(\"Phone number missing or incorrect.\"); } // validate the message if (args.message) { message.push(\"message:\" + args.message); } // return the result if (errors.length) { var errs = \"\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\" + errors.join(\"\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\") + \"\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\"; return { body: \"\u003ch1\u003eErrors!\u003c/h1\u003e\" + errs + '\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"javascript:window.history.back()\"\u003eBack\u003c/a\u003e' }; } else { var data = \"\u003cpre\u003e\" + message.join(\"\\n\") + \"\u003c/pre\u003e\"; return { body: \"\u003ch1\u003eThank you!\u003c/h1\u003e\" + data, name: args.name, email: args.email, phone: args.phone, message: args.message }; } } ","categories":"","description":"Learn how to add form validation from front to back-end","excerpt":"Learn how to add form validation from front to back-end","ref":"/docs/tutorial/form-validation/","tags":"","title":"Form validation"},{"body":"Installation Overview This page provides an overview of the installation process.\nBefore installation Please ensure you have:\ndownloaded the installer satisfied the prerequisites configured your installation Core Installation Once you have completed the preparation steps, you can proceed with:\na local installation on your local machine a single server installation on a Linux server a clustered installation on a Kubernetes cluster. 💡 NOTE\nThe install process will notify nuvolaris creators with the type of installation (for example: clustered or server installation), no other info will be submitted.

A package cannot contain another package, so package nesting is not allowed. Also, entities do not have to be contained in a package.\nIn OpenServerless a namespace corresponds to an user. You can create users with the admin subcommand of the CLI.\nThe fully qualified name of an entity is /namespaceName[/packageName]/entityName. Notice that / is used to delimit namespaces, packages, and entities.\nIf the fully qualified name has three parts: /namespaceName/packageName/entityName, then the namespace can be entered without a prefixed /; otherwise, namespaces must be prefixed with a /.\nFor convenience, the namespace can be left off if it is the user’s default namespace.\nFor example, consider a user whose default namespace is /myOrg. Following are examples of the fully qualified names of a number of entities and their aliases.\nFully qualified name Alias Namespace Package Name /whisk.system/cloudant/read\n/whisk.system\ncloudant\nread\n/myOrg/video/transcode\nvideo/transcode\n/myOrg\nvideo\ntranscode\n/myOrg/filter\nfilter\n/myOrg\nfilter\nYou will be using this naming scheme when you use the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless CLI, among other places.\nEntity names The names of all entities, including actions, triggers, rules, packages, and namespaces, are a sequence of characters that follow the following format:\nThe first character must be an alphanumeric character, or an underscore.\nThe subsequent characters can be alphanumeric, spaces, or any of the following: _, @, ., -.\nThe last character can’t be a space.\nMore precisely, a name must match the following regular expression (expressed with Java metacharacter syntax): \\A([\\w]|[\\w][\\w@ .-]*[\\w@.-]+)\\z.\nSystem limits Actions OpenWhisk and OpenServerless has a few system limits, including how much memory an action can use and how many action invocations are allowed per minute.\nNote: On Openwhisk 2.0 with the scheduler service, concurrent in the table below really means the max containers that can be provisioned at once for a namespace. The api may be able to accept more activations than this number at once depending on a number of factors.\nThe following table lists the default limits for actions.\nlimit description configurable unit default timeout\na container is not allowed to run longer than N milliseconds\nper action\nmilliseconds\n60000\nmemory\na container is not allowed to allocate more than N MB of memory\nper action\nMB\n256\nlogs\na container is not allowed to write more than N MB to stdout\nper action\nMB\n10\ninstances\nan action is not allowed to have more containers than this value (new scheduler only)\nper action\nnumber\nnamespace concurrency limit\nconcurrent\nno more than N activations may be submitted per namespace either executing or queued for execution\nper namespace\nnumber\n100\nminuteRate\nno more than N activations may be submitted per namespace per minute\nper namespace\nnumber\n120\ncodeSize\nthe maximum size of the action code\nconfigurable, limit per action\nMB\n48\nparameters\nthe maximum size of the parameters that can be attached\nnot configurable, limit per action/package/trigger\nMB\n1\nresult\nthe maximum size of the action result\nnot configurable, limit per action\nMB\n1\nPer action timeout (ms) (Default: 60s) The timeout limit N is in the range [100ms..300000ms] and is set per action in milliseconds.\nA user can change the limit when creating the action.\nA container that runs longer than N milliseconds is terminated.\nPer action memory (MB) (Default: 256MB) The memory limit M is in the range from [128MB..512MB] and is set per action in MB.\nA user can change the limit when creating the action.\nA container cannot have more memory allocated than the limit.\nPer action max instance concurrency (Default: namespace limit for concurrent invocations) Only applicable using new scheduler The max containers that will be created for an action before throttling in the range from [1..concurrentInvocations limit for namespace]\nBy default the max allowed containers / server instances for an action is equal to the namespace limit.\nA user can change the limit when creating the action.\nDefining a lower limit than the namespace limit means your max container concurrency will be the action defined limit.\nIf using actionConcurrency \u003e 1 such that your action can handle multiple requests per instance, your true concurrency limit is actionContainerConcurrency * actionConcurrency.\nThe actions within a namespaces containerConcurrency total do not have to add up to the namespace limit though you can configure it that way to guarantee an action will get exactly the action container concurrency.\nFor example with a namespace limit of 30 with 2 actions each with a container limit of 20; if the first action is using 20, there will still be space for 10 for the other.\nPer action logs (MB) (Default: 10MB) The log limit N is in the range [0MB..10MB] and is set per action.\nA user can change the limit when creating or updating the action.\nLogs that exceed the set limit are truncated and a warning is added as the last output of the activation to indicate that the activation exceeded the set log limit.\nPer action artifact (MB) (Default: 48MB) The maximum code size for the action is 48MB.\nIt is recommended for a JavaScript action to use a tool to concatenate all source code including dependencies into a single bundled file.\nPer activation payload size (MB) (Fixed: 1MB) The maximum POST content size plus any curried parameters for an action invocation or trigger firing is 1MB. Per activation result size (MB) (Fixed: 1MB) The maximum size of a result returned from an action is 1MB.

All data arrives this way and the values can be set in a few different ways. The first option is to supply parameters when an action or package is created (or updated). This approach is useful for data that stays the same on every execution, equivalent to environment variables on other platforms, or for default values that might be overridden at invocation time. The second option is to supply parameters when the action is invoked - and this approach will override any parameters already set.\nThis page outlines how to configure parameters when deploying packages and actions, and how to supply parameters when invoking an action. There is also information on how to use a file to store the parameters and pass the filename, rather than supplying each parameter individually on the command-line.\nPassing parameters to an action at invoke time Parameters can be passed to the action when it is invoked. These examples use JavaScript but all the other languages work the same way.\nUse parameters in the action. For example, create ‘hello.js’ file with the following content: function main(params) { return {payload: 'Hello, ' + params.name + ' from ' + params.place}; } The input parameters are passed as a JSON object parameter to the main function. Notice how the name and place parameters are retrieved from the params object in this example.\nUpdate the action so it is ready to use: ops action update hello hello.js Parameters can be provided explicitly on the command-line, or by supplying a file containing the desired parameters To pass parameters directly through the command-line, supply a key/value pair to the --param flag: ops action invoke --result hello --param name Dorothy --param place Kansas\nThis produces the result:\n{ \"payload\": \"Hello, Dorothy from Kansas\" } Notice the use of the --result option: it implies a blocking invocation where the CLI waits for the activation to complete and then displays only the result. For convenience, this option may be used without --blocking which is automatically inferred.\nAdditionally, if parameter values specified on the command-line are valid JSON, then they will be parsed and sent to your action as a structured object. For example, if we update our hello action to:\nfunction main(params) { return {payload: 'Hello, ' + params.person.name + ' from ' + params.person.place}; } Now the action expects a single person parameter to have fields name and place. If we invoke the action with a single person parameter that is valid JSON:\nops action invoke --result hello -p person '{\"name\": \"Dorothy\", \"place\": \"Kansas\"}' The result is the same because the CLI automatically parses the person parameter value into the structured object that the action now expects: json { \"payload\": \"Hello, Dorothy from Kansas\" }\nSetting default parameters on an action Actions can be invoked with multiple named parameters. Recall that the hello action from the previous example expects two parameters: the name of a person, and the place where they’re from.\nRather than pass all the parameters to an action every time, you can bind certain parameters. The following example binds the place parameter so that the action defaults to the place “Kansas”:\nUpdate the action by using the --param option to bind parameter values, or by passing a file that contains the parameters to --param-file (for examples of using files, see the section on working with parameter files. To specify default parameters explicitly on the command-line, provide a key/value pair to the param flag:\nops action update hello --param place Kansas Invoke the action, passing only the name parameter this time. ops action invoke --result hello --param name Dorothy { \"payload\": \"Hello, Dorothy from Kansas\" } Notice that you did not need to specify the place parameter when you invoked the action. Bound parameters can still be overwritten by specifying the parameter value at invocation time.\nInvoke the action, passing both name and place values, and observe the output: ops action invoke --result hello --param name Dorothy --param place \"Washington, DC\" { \"payload\": \"Hello, Dorothy from Washington, DC\" } Despite a parameter set on the action when it was created/updated, this is overridden by a parameter that was supplied when invoking the action.\nSetting default parameters on a package Parameters can be set at the package level, and these will serve as default parameters for actions unless:\nThe action itself has a default parameter.\nThe action has a parameter supplied at invoke time, which will always be the “winner” where more than one parameter is available.\nThe following example sets a default parameter of name on the MyApp package and shows an action making use of it.\nCreate a package with a parameter set: ops package update MyApp --param name World Create an action in this package: function main(params) { return {payload: \"Hello, \" + params.name}; } ops action update MyApp/hello hello.js Invoke the action, and observe the default package parameter in use: ops action invoke --result MyApp/hello { \"payload\": \"Hello, World\" } Working with parameter files It’s also possible to put parameters into a file in JSON format, and then pass the parameters in by supplying the filename with the param-file flag. This works for both packages and actions when creating/updating them, and when invoking actions.\nAs an example, consider the very simple hello example from earlier. Using hello.js with this content: function main(params) { return {payload: 'Hello, ' + params.name + ' from ' + params.place}; } Update the action with the updated contents of hello.js: ops action update hello hello.js Create a parameter file called parameters.json containing JSON-formatted parameters: { \"name\": \"Dorothy\", \"place\": \"Kansas\" } Use the parameters.json filename when invoking the action, and observe the output ops action invoke --result hello --param-file parameters.json { \"payload\": \"Hello, Dorothy from Kansas\" } ","categories":"","description":"Supply data to actions adding parameters","excerpt":"Supply data to actions adding parameters","ref":"/docs/reference/entities/parameters/","tags":"","title":"Parameters"},{"body":"Using REST APIs with OpenWhisk and OpenServerless After your OpenWhisk and OpenServerlesss environment is enabled, you can use it with your web apps or mobile apps with REST API calls.\nFor more details about the APIs for actions, activations, packages, rules, and triggers, see the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless API documentation.\nAll the capabilities in the system are available through a REST API. There are collection and entity endpoints for actions, triggers, rules, packages, activations, and namespaces.\nThese are the collection endpoints:\nhttps://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/actions https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/triggers https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/rules https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/packages https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/activations https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/limits The $APIHOST is the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless API hostname (for example, localhost, 172.17.0.1, and so on). For the {namespace}, the character _ can be used to specify the user’s default namespace.\nYou can perform a GET request on the collection endpoints to fetch a list of entities in the collection.\nThere are entity endpoints for each type of entity:\nhttps://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace} https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/actions/[{packageName}/]{actionName} https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/triggers/{triggerName} https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/rules/{ruleName} https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/packages/{packageName} https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/activations/{activationName} The namespace and activation endpoints support only GET requests. The actions, triggers, rules, and packages endpoints support GET, PUT, and DELETE requests. The endpoints of actions, triggers, and rules also support POST requests, which are used to invoke actions and triggers and enable or disable rules.\nAll APIs are protected with HTTP Basic authentication. You can use the ops admin tool to generate a new namespace and authentication. The Basic authentication credentials are in the AUTH property in your ~/.nuvprops file, delimited by a colon. You can also retrieve these credentials using the CLI running ops property get --auth.\nThe following is an example that uses the cURL command tool to get the list of all packages in the whisk.system namespace:\ncurl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/whisk.system/packages [ { \"name\": \"slack\", \"binding\": false, \"publish\": true, \"annotations\": [ { \"key\": \"description\", \"value\": \"Package that contains actions to interact with the Slack messaging service\" } ], \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"namespace\": \"whisk.system\" } ] In this example the authentication was passed using the -u flag, you can pass this value also as part of the URL as https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@$APIHOST.\nThe OpenWhisk API supports request-response calls from web clients. OpenWhisk responds to OPTIONS requests with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing headers. Currently, all origins are allowed (that is, Access-Control-Allow-Origin is “*”), the standard set of methods are allowed (that is, Access-Control-Allow-Methods is GET, DELETE, POST, PUT, HEAD), and Access-Control-Allow-Headers yields Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, User-Agent.\nAttention: Because OpenWhisk and OpenServerless currently supports only one key per namespace, it is not recommended to use CORS beyond simple experiments. Use Web Actions to expose your actions to the public and not use the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless authorization key for client applications that require CORS.\nUsing the CLI verbose mode The OpenWhisk and OpenServerless CLI is an interface to the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless REST API. You can run the CLI in verbose mode with the flag -v, this will print truncated information about the HTTP request and response. To print all information use the flag -d for debug.\nNote: HTTP request and response bodies will only be truncated if they exceed 1000 bytes.\nLet’s try getting the namespace value for the current user.\nops namespace list -v REQUEST: [GET] https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces Req Headers { \"Authorization\": [ \"Basic XXXYYYY\" ], \"User-Agent\": [ \"OpenWhisk and OpenServerless-CLI/1.0 (2017-08-10T20:09:30+00:00)\" ] } RESPONSE:Got response with code 200 Resp Headers { \"Content-Type\": [ \"application/json; charset=UTF-8\" ] } Response body size is 28 bytes Response body received: [\"john@example.com_dev\"] As you can see you the printed information provides the properties of the HTTP request, it performs a HTTP method GET on the URL https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces using a User-Agent header OpenWhisk and OpenServerless-CLI/1.0 (\u003cCLI-Build-version\u003e) and Basic Authorization header Basic XXXYYYY. Notice that the authorization value is your base64-encoded OpenWhisk and OpenServerless authorization string. The response is of content type application/json.\nActions Note: In the examples that follow, $AUTH and $APIHOST represent environment variables set respectively to your OpenWhisk and OpenServerless authorization key and API host.\nTo create or update an action send a HTTP request with method PUT on the the actions collection. For example, to create a nodejs:6 action with the name hello using a single file content use the following:\ncurl -u $AUTH -d '{\"namespace\":\"_\",\"name\":\"hello\",\"exec\":{\"kind\":\"nodejs:6\",\"code\":\"function main(params) { return {payload:\\\"Hello \\\"+params.name}}\"}}' -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/_/actions/hello?overwrite=true To perform a blocking invocation on an action, send a HTTP request with a method POST and body containing the input parameter name use the following:\ncurl -u $AUTH https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/_/actions/hello?blocking=true \\ -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"name\":\"John\"}' You get the following response:\n{ \"duration\": 2, \"name\": \"hello\", \"subject\": \"john@example.com_dev\", \"activationId\": \"c7bb1339cb4f40e3a6ccead6c99f804e\", \"publish\": false, \"annotations\": [{ \"key\": \"limits\", \"value\": { \"timeout\": 60000, \"memory\": 256, \"logs\": 10 } }, { \"key\": \"path\", \"value\": \"john@example.com_dev/hello\" }], \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"response\": { \"result\": { \"payload\": \"Hello John\" }, \"success\": true, \"status\": \"success\" }, \"end\": 1493327653769, \"logs\": [], \"start\": 1493327653767, \"namespace\": \"john@example.com_dev\" } If you just want to get the response.result, run the command again with the query parameter result=true\ncurl -u $AUTH \"https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/_/actions/hello?blocking=true\u0026result=true\" \\ -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"name\":\"John\"}' You get the following response:\n{ \"payload\": \"hello John\" } Annotations and Web Actions To create an action as a web action, you need to add an annotation of web-export=true for web actions. Since web-actions are publicly accessible, you should protect pre-defined parameters (i.e., treat them as final) using the annotation final=true. If you create or update an action using the CLI flag --web true this command will add both annotations web-export=true and final=true.\nRun the curl command providing the complete list of annotations to set on the action\ncurl -u $AUTH https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/_/actions/hello?overwrite=true \\ -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"namespace\":\"_\",\"name\":\"hello\",\"exec\":{\"kind\":\"nodejs:6\",\"code\":\"function main(params) { return {payload:\\\"Hello \\\"+params.name}}\"},\"annotations\":[{\"key\":\"web-export\",\"value\":true},{\"key\":\"raw-http\",\"value\":false},{\"key\":\"final\",\"value\":true}]}' You can now invoke this action as a public URL with no OpenWhisk and OpenServerless authorization. Try invoking using the web action public URL including an optional extension such as .json or .http for example at the end of the URL.\ncurl https://$APIHOST/api/v1/web/john@example.com_dev/default/hello.json?name=John { \"payload\": \"Hello John\" } Note that this example source code will not work with .http, see web actions documentation on how to modify.\nSequences To create an action sequence, you need to create it by providing the names of the actions that compose the sequence in the desired order, so the output from the first action is passed as input to the next action.\n$ ops action create sequenceAction –sequence /whisk-system/utils/split,/whisk-system/utils/sort\nCreate a sequence with the actions /whisk-system/utils/split and /whisk-system/utils/sort.\ncurl -u $AUTH https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/_/actions/sequenceAction?overwrite=true \\ -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"namespace\":\"_\",\"name\":\"sequenceAction\",\"exec\":{\"kind\":\"sequence\",\"components\":[\"/whisk.system/utils/split\",\"/whisk.system/utils/sort\"]},\"annotations\":[{\"key\":\"web-export\",\"value\":true},{\"key\":\"raw-http\",\"value\":false},{\"key\":\"final\",\"value\":true}]}' Take into account when specifying the names of the actions, they have to be full qualified.\nTriggers To create a trigger, the minimum information you need is a name for the trigger. You could also include default parameters that get passed to the action through a rule when the trigger gets fired.\nCreate a trigger with name events with a default parameter type with value webhook set.\ncurl -u $AUTH https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/_/triggers/events?overwrite=true \\ -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"name\":\"events\",\"parameters\":[{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"webhook\"}]}' Now whenever you have an event that needs to fire this trigger it just takes an HTTP request with a method POST using the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless Authorization key.\nTo fire the trigger events with a parameter temperature, send the following HTTP request.\ncurl -u $AUTH https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/_/triggers/events \\ -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"temperature\":60}' Rules To create a rule that associates a trigger with an action, send a HTTP request with a PUT method providing the trigger and action in the body of the request.\ncurl -u $AUTH https://$APIHOST/api/v1/namespaces/_/rules/t2a?overwrite=true \\ -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{\"name\":\"t2a\",\"status\":\"\",\"trigger\":\"/_/events\",\"action\":\"/_/hello\"}' Rules can be enabled or disabled, and you can change the status of the rule by updating its status property.

Annotations are attached to assets just like parameters with a key that defines a name and value that defines the value. It is convenient to set them from the command line interface (CLI) via --annotation or -a for short.\nRationale: Annotations were added to OpenWhisk and OpenServerless to allow for experimentation without making changes to the underlying asset schema. We had, until the writing of this document, deliberately not defined what annotations are permitted. However as we start to use annotations more heavily to impart semantic changes, it’s important that we finally start to document them.\nThe most prevalent use of annotations to date is to document actions and packages. You’ll see many of the packages in the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless catalog carry annotations such as a description of the functionality offered by their actions, which parameters are required at package binding time, and which are invoke-time parameters, whether a parameter is a “secret” (e.g., password), or not. We have invented these as needed, for example to allow for UI integration.\nHere is a sample set of annotations for an echo action which returns its input arguments unmodified (e.g., function main(args) { return args }). This action may be useful for logging input parameters for example as part of a sequence or rule.\nops action create echo echo.js \\ -a description 'An action which returns its input. Useful for logging input to enable debug/replay.' \\ -a parameters '[{ \"required\":false, \"description\": \"Any JSON entity\" }]' \\ -a sampleInput '{ \"msg\": \"Five fuzzy felines\"}' \\ -a sampleOutput '{ \"msg\": \"Five fuzzy felines\"}' The annotations we have used for describing packages are:\ndescription: a pithy description of the package\nparameters: an array describing parameters that are scoped to the package (described further below)\nSimilarly, for actions:\ndescription: a pithy description of the action\nparameters: an array describing actions that are required to execute the action\nsampleInput: an example showing the input schema with typical values\nsampleOutput: an example showing the output schema, usually for the sampleInput\nThe annotations we have used for describing parameters include:\nname: the name of the parameter\ndescription: a pithy description of the parameter\ndoclink: a link to further documentation for parameter (useful for OAuth tokens for example)\nrequired: true for required parameters and false for optional ones\nbindTime: true if the parameter should be specified when a package is bound\ntype: the type of the parameter, one of password, array (but may be used more broadly)\nThe annotations are not checked. So while it is conceivable to use the annotations to infer if a composition of two actions into a sequence is legal, for example, the system does not yet do that.\nAnnotations for all actions The following annotations on an action are available.\nprovide-api-key: This annotation may be attached to actions which require an API key, for example to make REST API calls to the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless host. For newly created actions, if not specified, it defaults to a false value. For existing actions, the absence of this annotation, or its presence with a value that is not falsy (i.e., a value that is different from zero, null, false, and the empty string) will cause an API key to be present in the action execution context. Annotations specific to web actions Web actions are enabled with explicit annotations which decorate individual actions. The annotations only apply to the web actions API, and must be present and explicitly set to true to have an affect. The annotations have no meaning otherwise in the system. The annotations are:\nweb-export: Makes its corresponding action accessible to REST calls without authentication. We call these web actions because they allow one to use OpenWhisk and OpenServerless actions from a browser for example. It is important to note that the owner of the web action incurs the cost of running them in the system (i.e., the owner of the action also owns the activations record). The rest of the annotations described below have no effect on the action unless this annotation is also set.\nfinal: Makes all of the action parameters that are already defined immutable. A parameter of an action carrying the annotation may not be overridden by invoke-time parameters once the parameter has a value defined through its enclosing package or the action definition.\nraw-http: When set, the HTTP request query and body parameters are passed to the action as reserved properties.\nweb-custom-options: When set, this annotation enables a web action to respond to OPTIONS requests with customized headers, otherwise a default CORS response applies.\nrequire-whisk-auth: This annotation protects the web action so that it is only invoked by requests that provide appropriate authentication credentials. When set to a boolean value, it controls whether or not the request’s Basic Authentication value (i.e. Whisk auth key) will be authenticated - a value of true will authenticate the credentials, a value of false will invoke the action without any authentication. When set to a number or a string, this value must match the request’s X-Require-Whisk-Auth header value. In both cases, it is important to note that the owner of the web action will still incur the cost of running them in the system (i.e., the owner of the action also owns the activations record).\nAnnotations specific to activations The system decorates activation records with annotations as well. They are:\npath: the fully qualified path name of the action that generated the activation. Note that if this activation was the result of an action in a package binding, the path refers to the parent package.\nbinding: the entity path of the package binding. Note that this is only present for actions in a package binding.\nkind: the kind of action executed, and one of the support OpenWhisk and OpenServerless runtime kinds.\nlimits: the time, memory and log limits that this activation were subject to.\nAdditionally for sequence related activations, the system will generate the following annotations:\ntopmost: this is only present for an outermost sequence action.\ncausedBy: this is only present for actions that are contained in a sequence.\nLastly, and in order to provide you with some performance transparency, activations also record:\nwaitTime: the time spent waiting in the internal OpenWhisk and OpenServerless system. This is roughly the time spent between the controller receiving the activation request and when the invoker provisioned a container for the action.\ninitTime: the time spent initializing the function. If this value is present, the action required initialization and represents a cold start. A warm activation will skip initialization, and in this case, the annotation is not generated.\nAn example of these annotations as they would appear in an activation record is shown below.\n\"annotations\": [ { \"key\": \"path\", \"value\": \"guest/echo\" }, { \"key\": \"waitTime\", \"value\": 66 }, { \"key\": \"kind\", \"value\": \"nodejs:6\" }, { \"key\": \"initTime\", \"value\": 50 }, { \"key\": \"limits\", \"value\": { \"logs\": 10, \"memory\": 256, \"timeout\": 60000 } } ] ","categories":"","description":"How to use annotations to decorate actions","excerpt":"How to use annotations to decorate actions","ref":"/docs/reference/entities/annotations/","tags":"","title":"Annotations"},{"body":"Install K3S in a server You can install OpenServerless as described here, and you do not need to install any Kubernetes in it, as it is installed as part of the procedure.

For example, an action executing a SQL script to create a PostgreSQL Database or inserting reference data, or simply an action that sends notifications with an API call every day at the same time.\nHow to Activate the Scheduler Using the ops CLI, you can enable the scheduler with the following command:\nops config enable --cron # if OpenServerless is not yet deployed ops setup devcluster # alternatively if OpenServerless is already deployed ops update apply By default, the internal scheduler executes a job every minute that starts searching for OpenWhisk actions with special annotations.\nHow to Deploy a Repetitive Action Let’s assume we want to deploy an OpenWhisk action to be executed every 30 minutes. Suppose it’s an action that simply prints something, like this:\ndef main(args): print('Hello from a repeated action') return { 'body': 'action invoked' } abd save it to a file called scheduled-action.py\nTo deploy the action and instruct OpenServerless to execute it every 30 minutes, issue the following command:\nops action create scheduled-action scheduled-action.py -a cron \"*/30 * * * *\"\nSo you can create the action in the usual way and at the end add -a cron yourCronExpression.\nHow to Deploy a One-Shot Execution Action Now suppose we want to execute the same action scheduled-action.py only once.\nTo deploy an action and request a single execution automatically via the OpenServerless Scheduler, issue the following command:\nops action create scheduled-action scheduled-action.py -a autoexec true\nIf we now print activation logs with ops activation poll, we will see our action execution log:\nActivation: 'scheduled' (ebd532139a464e9d9532139a46ae9d8a) [ \"2024-03-08T07:28:02.050739962Z stdout: Hello from a scheduled action\" ] Remarks The Scheduler executes the action according to the following rules:\nActions are called in a non-blocking fashion.

Therefore, a sequence represents a logical junction between two or more actions, where each action is invoked in a specific order.\nCombine actions sequentially Suppose we want to describe an algorithm for preparing a pizza. We could prepare everything in a single action, creating it all in one go, from preparing the dough to adding all the ingredients and cooking it.\nWhat if you would like to edit only a specific part of your algorithm, like adding fresh tomato instead of classic, or reducing the amount of water in your pizza dough? Every time, you have to edit your main action to modify only a part.\nAgain, what if before returning a pizza you’d like to invoke a new action like “add basil,” or if you decide to refrigerate the pizza dough after preparing it but before cooking it?\nThis is where sequences come into play.\nCreate a file called preparePizzaDough.js\nfunction main(args) { let persons = args.howManyPerson; let flour = persons * 180; // grams let water = persons * 120; // ml let yeast = (flour + water) * 0.02; let pizzaDough = \"Mix \" + flour + \" grams of flour with \" + water + \" ml of water and add \" + yeast + \" grams of brewer's yeast\"; return { pizzaDough: pizzaDough, whichPizza: args.whichPizza, }; } Now, in a file cookPizza.js\nfunction main(args) { let pizzaDough = args.pizzaDough; let whichPizza = args.whichPizza; let baseIngredients = \"tomato and mozzarella\"; if (whichPizza === \"Margherita\") { return { result: \"Cook \" + pizzaDough + \" topped with \" + baseIngredients + \" for 3 minutes at 380°C\", }; } else if (whichPizza === \"Sausage\") { baseIngredients += \"plus sausage\"; return { result: \"Cook \" + pizzaDough + \" topped with \" + baseIngredients + \". Cook for 3 minutes at 380°C\", }; } } We have now split our code to prepare pizza into two different actions. When we need to edit only one action without editing everything, we can do it! Otherwise, we can now add new actions that can be invoked or not before cooking pizza (or after).\nLet’s try it.\nTesting the sequence First, create our two actions\nops action create preparePizzaDough preparePizzaDough.js ops action create cookPizza cookPizza.js Now, we can create the sequence:\nops action create pizzaSequence --sequence preparePizzaDough,cookPizza Finally, let’s invoke it\nops action invoke --result pizzaSequence -p howManyPerson 4 -p whichPizza \"Margherita\" { \"result\": \"Cook Mix 720 grams of flour with 480 ml of water and add 24 grams of brewer's yeast topped with tomato and mozzarella for 3 minutes at 380°C\" } Conclusion Now, thanks to sequences, our code is split correctly, and we are able to scale it more easily!\n","categories":"","description":"Combine actions in sequences","excerpt":"Combine actions in sequences","ref":"/docs/cli/entities/sequences/","tags":"","title":"Sequences"},{"body":"Use database Storing the Message in the Database We are ready to use the database that we enabled at the beginning of the tutorial.\nUsually, when working with relational databases, the best choice is to use a schema migration system. In our case, to keep things simple, we will emulate a migration using an action.\nNow, we need to create a table to store the contact data: start by creating a new action called create-table.js in the packages/contact folder.\nThe directory structure have to be like this:\ncontact_us_app ├── packages │ └── contact │ ├── create-table.js │ └── submit.js └── web └── index.html Put this content inside the create-table.js file:\n//--kind nodejs:default //--param POSTGRES_URL $POSTGRES_URL const { Client } = require('pg') async function main(args) { console.log('Starting create-table action') const client = new Client({ connectionString: args.POSTGRES_URL }); const createSchema = `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS demo;` const createTable = ` CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS demo.contacts ( id serial PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(50), email varchar(50), phone varchar(50), message varchar(300) ); ` try { console.log(`Connecting to ${args.POSTGRES_URL}`); await client.connect(); console.log('Connected to database'); await client.query(createSchema); console.log('Schema demo created'); await client.query(createTable); console.log('Contact table created'); return { result: 'OK' }; } catch (e) { if (e instanceof AggregateError) { for (const err of e.errors) { console.error('[ERROR] - ', err.message || err); } } else if (e instanceof Error) { console.error('[ERROR] - ', e.message); } else { console.error('[ERROR] - ', e); } return { result: 'ERROR' }; } finally { console.log('Closing connection'); if (client) { await client.end(); } } } 💡 NOTE\nYou may have noticed here again the comments on top of the file.

In particular:\n--kind nodejs:default will ask OpenServerless to run this code on the nodejs default runtime. the --param POSTGRES_URL $POSTGRES_URL will automatically fill in the parameters required by the action, taking it's value from ops's configuration file. The action is idempotent, so you may call the action multiple times, but the schema and the table is created only once.\nYou can deploy this action using ops ide deploy command.\nops ide deploy The output will be like:\n/home/openserverless/.ops/tmp/deploy.pid PID 52906 \u003e Scan: \u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/create-table.js \u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/submit.js \u003e Deploying: \u003e\u003e Package: contact $ $OPS package update contact ok: updated package contact \u003e\u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/create-table.js $ $OPS action update contact/create-table packages/contact/create-table.js --kind nodejs:default --param POSTGRES_URL $POSTGRES_URL ok: updated action contact/create-table \u003e\u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/submit.js $ $OPS action update contact/submit packages/contact/submit.js --web true --kind nodejs:default ok: updated action contact/submit build process exited with code 0 UPLOAD ASSETS FROM web ==================| UPLOAD RESULTS |================== | FILES : 1 | COMPLETED : 1 | ERRORS : 0 | SKIPPED : 0 | EXEC.

There is also a console.log on the response in case we want to check some logs again.\nLet’s deploy it:\nops ide deploy /home/openserverless/.ops/tmp/deploy.pid /Users/bruno/.ops/tmp/deploy.pid PID 57700 \u003e Scan: \u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/write.js \u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/create-table.js \u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/submit.js \u003e Deploying: \u003e\u003e Package: contact $ $OPS package update contact ok: updated package contact \u003e\u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/write.js $ $OPS action update contact/write packages/contact/write.js --kind nodejs:default --param POSTGRES_URL $POSTGRES_URL ok: updated action contact/write \u003e\u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/create-table.js $ $OPS action update contact/create-table packages/contact/create-table.js --kind nodejs:default --param POSTGRES_URL $POSTGRES_URL ok: updated action contact/create-table \u003e\u003e\u003e Action: packages/contact/submit.js $ $OPS action update contact/submit packages/contact/submit.js --web true --kind nodejs:default ok: updated action contact/submit build process exited with code 0 UPLOAD ASSETS FROM web ==================| UPLOAD RESULTS |================== | FILES : 1 | COMPLETED : 1 | ERRORS : 0 | SKIPPED : 0 | EXEC. TIME : 28.92 ms ====================================================== URL: http://opstutorial.localhost:80 Finalizing the Submit Alright, we are almost done. We just need to create a pipeline of submit → write actions. The submit action returns the 4 form fields together with the HTML body. The write action expects those 4 fields to store them. Let’s put them together into a sequence:\nops action create contact/submit-write --sequence contact/submit,contact/write --web true ok: created action contact/submit-write With this command we created a new action called submit-write that is a sequence of submit and write. This means that OpenServerless will call in a sequence submit first, then get its output and use it as input to call write.\nNow the pipeline is complete, and we can test it by submitting the form again. This time the data will be stored in the database.\nNote that write passes on the HTML body so we can still see the thank you message. If we want to hide it, we can just remove the body property from the return value of write. We are still returning the other 4 fields, so another action can use them (spoiler: it will happen next chapter).\nLet’s check out again the action list:\nops action list actions /opstutorial/contact/submit-write private sequence /opstutorial/contact/submit private nodejs:21 /opstutorial/contact/create-table private nodejs:21 /opstutorial/contact/write private nodejs:21 You probably have something similar. Note the submit-write is managed as an action, but it’s actually a sequence of 2 actions. This is a very powerful feature of OpenServerless, as it allows you to create complex pipelines of actions that can be managed as a single unit.\nTrying the Sequence As before, we have to update our index.html to use the new action. First let’s get the URL of the submit-write action:\nops url contact/submit-write \u003capihost\u003e/api/v1/web/openserverless/contact/submit-write Then we can update the index.html file. Change the form submit action with the url from the previous command:\n\u003cform method=\"POST\" action=\"/api/v1/web/opstutorial/contact/submit-write\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\u003e We just need to add -write to the action name.\nNow give a ops ide deploy to publish all the modifications.\nTry again to fill the contact form (with correct data) and submit it. This time the data will be stored in the database.\nView data from db If you want to retrieve data from your database, ops provides several utilities under the ops devel command. They are useful to interact with the integrated services, such as the database we are using.\nFor instance, to interact with PostgreSQL database, let’s run:\necho \"SELECT * FROM demo.CONTACTS\" | ops devel psql sql --format=table You should see an output like this:\n┌───┬────┬────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐ │ │ id │ name │ email │ phone │ message │ ├───┼────┼────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤ │ 0 │ 1 │ OpenServerless │ user@openserverless.dev │ 39123123123 │ Hello Apache OpenServerless! │ └───┴────┴────────────────┴─────────────────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘ ","categories":"","description":"Store data into a relational database","excerpt":"Store data into a relational database","ref":"/docs/tutorial/use-database/","tags":"","title":"Use database"},{"body":"Installation Overview If you are in hurry and you think this guide is TL;DR (too long, don’t read), please read at least our Quick Start single page installation guide.\nIt gives you an overview of the installation process, omitting some more advanced details.

You can get a list of packages in a namespace, list the entities in a package, and get a description of the individual entities in a package.\nGet a list of packages in the /nuvolaris namespace. $ ops package list /nuvolaris packages /nuvolaris/openai private /nuvolaris/mastrogpt private /nuvolaris/examples private Get a list of entities in the /nuvolaris/openai package. $ ops package get --summary /nuvolaris/openai package /nuvolaris/openai (parameters: none defined) action /nuvolaris/openai/models (parameters: none defined) action /nuvolaris/openai/chat (parameters: none defined) Note: Parameters listed under the package with a prefix * are predefined, bound parameters. Parameters without a * are those listed under the annotations for each entity. Furthermore, any parameters with the prefix ** are finalized bound parameters. This means that they are immutable, and cannot be changed by the user. Any entity listed under a package inherits specific bound parameters from the package. To view the list of known parameters of an entity belonging to a package, you will need to run a get --summary of the individual entity.\nGet a description of the /nuvolaris/openai/chat action. $ ops action get --summary /nuvolaris/openai/chat action /nuvolaris/openai/chat: Returns a result based on parameters OPENAI_API_HOST and OPENAI_API_KEY (parameters: **OPENAI_API_HOST, **OPENAI_API_KEY) NOTE: Notice that the parameters listed for the action read were expanded upon from the action summary compared to the package summary above. To see the official bound parameters for actions and triggers listed under packages, run an individual get summary for the particular entity.\nCreating a package A package is used to organize a set of related actions and feeds. It also allows for parameters to be shared across all entities in the package.\nTo create a custom package with a simple action in it, try the following example:\nCreate a package called custom. $ ops package create custom ok: created package custom Get a summary of the package. $ ops package get --summary custom package /myNamespace/custom (parameters: none defined) Notice that the package is empty.\nCreate a file called identity.js that contains the following action code. This action returns all input parameters. function main(args) { return args; } Create an identity action in the custom package. $ ops action create custom/identity identity.js ok: created action custom/identity Creating an action in a package requires that you prefix the action name with a package name. Package nesting is not allowed. A package can contain only actions and can’t contain another package.\nGet a summary of the package again. $ ops package get --summary custom package /myNamespace/custom (parameters: none defined) action /myNamespace/custom/identity (parameters: none defined) You can see the custom/identity action in your namespace now.\nInvoke the action in the package. $ ops action invoke --result custom/identity {} You can set default parameters for all the entities in a package. You do this by setting package-level parameters that are inherited by all actions in the package. To see how this works, try the following example:\nUpdate the custom package with two parameters: city and country. $ ops package update custom --param city Austin --param country USA ok: updated package custom Display the parameters in the package and action, and see how the identity action in the package inherits parameters from the package. $ ops package get custom ok: got package custom ... \"parameters\": [ { \"key\": \"city\", \"value\": \"Austin\" }, { \"key\": \"country\", \"value\": \"USA\" } ] ... $ ops action get custom/identity ok: got action custom/identity ... \"parameters\": [ { \"key\": \"city\", \"value\": \"Austin\" }, { \"key\": \"country\", \"value\": \"USA\" } ] ... Invoke the identity action without any parameters to verify that the action indeed inherits the parameters. $ ops action invoke --result custom/identity { \"city\": \"Austin\", \"country\": \"USA\" } Invoke the identity action with some parameters. Invocation parameters are merged with the package parameters; the invocation parameters override the package parameters. $ ops action invoke --result custom/identity --param city Dallas --param state Texas { \"city\": \"Dallas\", \"country\": \"USA\", \"state\": \"Texas\" } Sharing a package After the actions and feeds that comprise a package are debugged and tested, the package can be shared with all OpenWhisk and OpenServerless users. Sharing the package makes it possible for the users to bind the package, invoke actions in the package, and author OpenWhisk and OpenServerless rules and sequence actions.\nShare the package with all users: $ ops package update custom --shared yes ok: updated package custom Display the publish property of the package to verify that it is now true. $ ops package get custom ok: got package custom ... \"publish\": true, ... Others can now use your custom package, including binding to the package or directly invoking an action in it. Other users must know the fully qualified names of the package to bind it or invoke actions in it. Actions and feeds within a shared package are public. If the package is private, then all of its contents are also private.\nGet a description of the package to show the fully qualified names of the package and action. $ ops package get --summary custom package /myNamespace/custom: Returns a result based on parameters city and country (parameters: *city, *country) action /myNamespace/custom/identity (parameters: none defined) In the previous example, you’re working with the myNamespace namespace, and this namespace appears in the fully qualified name.\n","categories":"","description":"Create and Use packages","excerpt":"Create and Use packages","ref":"/docs/reference/entities/packages/","tags":"","title":"Packages"},{"body":"Adding Action Language Runtimes OpenWhisk and OpenServerless supports several languages and runtimes but there may be other languages or runtimes that are important for your organization, and for which you want tighter integration with the platform.\nThe platform is extensible and you can add new languages or runtimes (with custom packages and third-party dependencies)\n💡 NOTE\nThis guide describes the contract a runtime must satisfy. However all the OpenServerless runtimes are implemented the using the ActionLoop Proxy. This proxy is implemented in Go, already satifies the semantic of a runtime ands makes very easy to build a new runtime. You just need to provide “launcher code” in your favorite programming language and a compilation script (generally written in python) for the initialization of an action. You are advised to use it for your own runtimes and use the material of this document as reference for the behaviour of a runtime.\nRuntime general requirements The unit of execution for all functions is a Docker container which must implement a specific Action interface that, in general performs:\nInitialization - accepts an initialization payload (the code) and prepared for execution,\nActivation - accepts a runtime payload (the input parameters) and\nprepares the activation context,\nruns the function,\nreturns the function result,\nLogging - flushes all stdout and stderr logs and adds a frame marker at the end of the activation.\nThe specifics of the Action interface and its functions are shown below.\nThe runtimes manifest Actions when created specify the desired runtime for the function via a property called kind. When using the nuv CLI, this is specified as --kind \u003cruntime-kind\u003e. The value is typically a string describing the language (e.g., nodejs) followed by a colon and the version for the runtime as in nodejs:20 or php:8.1.\nThe manifest is a map of runtime family names to an array of specific kinds. As an example, the following entry add a new runtime family called nodejs with a single kind nodejs:20.\n{ \"nodejs\": [{ \"kind\": \"nodejs:20\", \"default\": true, \"image\": { \"prefix\": \"openwhisk\", \"name\": \"action-nodejs-v20\", \"tag\": \"latest\" } }] } The default property indicates if the corresponding kind should be treated as the default for the runtime family. The JSON image structure defines the Docker image name that is used for actions of this kind (e.g., openwhisk/nodejs10action:latest for the JSON example above).\nThe test action The standard test action is shown below in JavaScript. It should be adapted for the new language and added to the test artifacts directory with the name \u003cruntime-kind\u003e.txt for plain text file or \u003cruntime-kind\u003e.bin for a a binary file. The \u003cruntime-kind\u003e must match the value used for kind in the corresponding runtime manifest entry, replacing : in the kind with a -. For example, a plain text function for nodejs:20 becomes nodejs-20.txt.\nfunction main(args) { var str = args.delimiter + \" ☃ \" + args.delimiter; console.log(str); return { \"winter\": str }; } Action Interface An action consists of the user function (and its dependencies) along with a proxy that implements a canonical protocol to integrate with the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform.\nThe proxy is a web server with two endpoints.\nIt listens on port 8080.\nIt implements /init to initialize the container.\nIt also implements /run to activate the function.\nThe proxy also prepares the execution context, and flushes the logs produced by the function to stdout and stderr.\nInitialization The initialization route is /init. It must accept a POST request with a JSON object as follows:\n{ \"value\": { \"name\" : String, \"main\" : String, \"code\" : String, \"binary\": Boolean, \"env\": Map[String, String] } } name is the name of the action.\nmain is the name of the function to execute.\ncode is either plain text or a base64 encoded string for binary functions (i.e., a compiled executable).\nbinary is false if code is in plain text, and true if code is base64 encoded.\nenv is a map of key-value pairs of properties to export to the environment. And contains several properties starting with the __OW_ prefix that are specific to the running action.\n__OW_API_KEY the API key for the subject invoking the action, this key may be a restricted API key. This property is absent unless explicitly requested.\n__OW_NAMESPACE the namespace for the activation (this may not be the same as the namespace for the action).\n__OW_ACTION_NAME the fully qualified name of the running action.\n__OW_ACTION_VERSION the internal version number of the running action.\n__OW_ACTIVATION_ID the activation id for this running action instance.\n__OW_DEADLINE the approximate time when this initializer will have consumed its entire duration quota (measured in epoch milliseconds).\nThe initialization route is called exactly once by the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform, before executing a function. The route should report an error if called more than once. It is possible however that a single initialization will be followed by many activations (via /run). If an env property is provided, the corresponding environment variables should be defined before the action code is initialized.\nSuccessful initialization: The route should respond with 200 OK if the initialization is successful and the function is ready to execute. Any content provided in the response is ignored.\nFailures to initialize: Any response other than 200 OK is treated as an error to initialize. The response from the handler if provided must be a JSON object with a single field called error describing the failure. The value of the error field may be any valid JSON value. The proxy should make sure to generate meaningful log message on failure to aid the end user in understanding the failure.\nTime limit: Every action in OpenWhisk and OpenServerless has a defined time limit (e.g., 60 seconds). The initialization must complete within the allowed duration. Failure to complete initialization within the allowed time frame will destroy the container.\nLimitation: The proxy does not currently receive any of the activation context at initialization time. There are scenarios where the context is convenient if present during initialization. This will require a change in the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform itself. Note that even if the context is available during initialization, it must be reset with every new activation since the information will change with every execution.\nActivation The proxy is ready to execute a function once it has successfully completed initialization. The OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform will invoke the function by posting an HTTP request to /run with a JSON object providing a new activation context and the input parameters for the function. There may be many activations of the same function against the same proxy (viz. container). Currently, the activations are guaranteed not to overlap — that is, at any given time, there is at most one request to /run from the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform.\nThe route must accept a JSON object and respond with a JSON object, otherwise the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform will treat the activation as a failure and proceed to destroy the container. The JSON object provided by the platform follows the following schema:\n{ \"value\": JSON, \"namespace\": String, \"action_name\": String, \"api_host\": String, \"api_key\": String, \"activation_id\": String, \"transaction_id\": String, \"deadline\": Number } value is a JSON object and contains all the parameters for the function activation.\nnamespace is the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless namespace for the action (e.g., whisk-system).\naction_name is the fully qualified name of the action.\nactivation_id is a unique ID for this activation.\ntransaction_id is a unique ID for the request of which this activation is part of.\ndeadline is the deadline for the function.\napi_key is the API key used to invoke the action.\nThe value is the function parameters. The rest of the properties become part of the activation context which is a set of environment variables constructed by capitalizing each of the property names, and prefixing the result with __OW_. Additionally, the context must define __OW_API_HOST whose value is the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless API host. This value is currently provided as an environment variable defined at container startup time and hence already available in the context.\nSuccessful activation: The route must respond with 200 OK if the activation is successful and the function has produced a JSON object as its result. The response body is recorded as the result of the activation.\nFailed activation: Any response other than 200 OK is treated as an activation error. The response from the handler must be a JSON object with a single field called error describing the failure. The value of the error field may be any valid JSON value. Should the proxy fail to respond with a JSON object, the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform will treat the failure as an uncaught exception. These two failures modes are distinguished by the value of the response.status in the activation record which is application error if the proxy returned an error object, and action developer error otherwise.\nTime limit: Every action in OpenWhisk and OpenServerless has a defined time limit (e.g., 60 seconds). The activation must complete within the allowed duration. Failure to complete activation within the allowed time frame will destroy the container.\nLogging The proxy must flush all the logs produced during initialization and execution and add a frame marker to denote the end of the log stream for an activation. This is done by emitting the token XXX_THE_END_OF_A_WHISK_ACTIVATION_XXX as the last log line for the stdout and stderr streams. Failure to emit this marker will cause delayed or truncated activation logs.\nTesting Action Interface tests The Action interface is enforced via a canonical test suite which validates the initialization protocol, the runtime protocol, ensures the activation context is correctly prepared, and that the logs are properly framed. Your runtime should extend this test suite, and of course include additional tests as needed.\nRuntime proxy tests The tests verify that the proxy can handle the following scenarios:\nTest the proxy can handle the identity functions (initialize and run).\nTest the proxy can handle pre-defined environment variables as well as initialization parameters.\nTest the proxy properly constructs the activation context.\nTest the proxy can properly handle functions with Unicode characters.\nTest the proxy can handle large payloads (more than 1MB).\nTest the proxy can handle an entry point other than main.\nTest the proxy does not permit re-initialization.\nTest the error handling for an action returning an invalid response.\nTest the proxy when initialized with no content.\nThe canonical test suite should be extended by the new runtime tests. Additional tests will be required depending on the feature set provided by the runtime.\nSince the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform is language and runtime agnostic, it is generally not necessary to add integration tests. That is the unit tests verifying the protocol are sufficient. However, it may be necessary in some cases to modify the ops CLI or other OpenWhisk and OpenServerless clients. In which case, appropriate tests should be added as necessary. The OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform will perform a generic integration test as part of its basic system tests. This integration test will require a test function to be available so that the test harness can create, invoke, and delete the action.\n","categories":"","description":"How to add new languages to your system","excerpt":"How to add new languages to your system","ref":"/docs/reference/references/actions-new/","tags":"","title":"Runtimes under the hood"},{"body":"Sending notifications Contact notification It would be great if we receive a notification when a user tries to contact us.\nFor this tutorial we will use a free service that instantly generates a unique URL through which you can receive and view webhook payloads in real time.\n💡 NOTE\nYou could replace this service with a workflow automation system, with your CRM webhook, with Slack hooks etc.\nBy navigating to the site https://webhook.site/ you will receive a unique url, as in the image below:\nTake note of the url under the “Your unique URL” title.\nOnce we have a webhook we can proceed to create a new action called notify.js (in the packages/contact folder).\nThe directory structure will be:\ncontact_us_app ├── packages │ └── contact │ ├── create-table.js │ ├── notify.js │ ├── submit.js │ └── write.js └── web └── index.html Place this content inside the notify.js file:\n// notify.js //--param NOTIFICATION_URL $NOTIFICATION_URL function main(args) { const { name, email, phone, message } = args; const subject = `New contact request from Apache OpenServerless`; const payload = { subject, name, email, phone, message, }; console.log(\"Built message\", payload); return fetch(args.NOTIFICATION_URL, { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }, body: JSON.stringify(payload), }) .then(response =\u003e { if (!response.ok) { console.log(\"Error sending message. Status code:\", response.status); } else { console.log(\"Message sent successfully\"); } return { body: args.body, }; }) .catch(error =\u003e { console.log(\"Error sending message\", error); return { body: error, }; }); } 💡 NOTE\nIn this case, we don’t need to annotate the action as web. This because this action will be invoked in a sequence: so it’s an internal action and is not exposed as an api.\nThis action has the args.NOTIFICATION_URL parameter, which is the webhook. It also has the usual 4 form fields parameters that receives in input, used to build the text of the message. The action will return the body of the response from the webhook.\nThe NOTIFICATION_URL may contains different values between a development environment and a production one. No problem! Apache OpenServerless deployer supports .env file. Create a .env file under the package directory.\nThe directory structure now will look like:\ncontact_us_app ├── packages │ ├── .env │ └── contact │ ├── create-table.js │ ├── notify.js │ ├── submit.js │ └── write.js └── web └── index.html Inside the .env file put this content:\nNOTIFICATION_URL=\u003curl\u003e Replace \u003curl\u003e with the url received from webhook.site.\nNow deploy everything as usual, giving:\nops ide deploy Creating Another Action Sequence We have developed an action that can send a message as a standalone action, but we designed it to take the output of the submit action and return it as is. Time to extend the previous sequence!\nNote that it will send messages for every submission, even for incorrect inputs, so we will know if someone is trying to use the form without providing all the information. But we will only store the fully validated data in the database.\nLet’s create the sequence, and then test it:\nops action create contact/submit-notify --sequence contact/submit-write,contact/notify --web true You should see this output:\nok: created action contact/submit-notify We just created a new sequence submit-notify from the previous sequence submit-write and the new notify.\nIf you want to get more info about this sequence, you can use the ops action get command:\nops action get contact/submit-notify You should see this output:\n{ \"namespace\": \"openserverless/contact\", \"name\": \"submit-notify\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"exec\": { \"kind\": \"sequence\", \"components\": [ \"/openserverless/contact/submit-write\", \"/openserverless/contact/notify\" ] }, ... } See how the exec key has a kind of sequence and a list of components that are the actions that compose the sequence.\nNow to start using this sequence instead of using the submit action, we need to update the web/index.html page to invoke the new sequence.\nAs before let’s grab the url:\nops url contact/submit-notify \u003capihost\u003e/api/v1/web/openserverless/contact/submit-notify And update the action inside the file web/index.html:\n\u003cform method=\"POST\" action=\"/api/v1/web/opstutorial/contact/submit-notify\" enctype=\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\u003e Don’t forget to re-publish everything with ops ide deploy.\nNow try to fill out the form again and press send! It will execute the sequence and you will receive the message piped from action /contact/submit-write to /contact/notify.\nThe tutorial introduced you to some utilities to retrieve information and to the concept of activation. Let’s use some more commands to check out the logs and see if the message was really sent.\nThe easiest way to check for all the activations that happen in this app with all their logs is:\nops activation poll Enter Ctrl-c to exit. Polling for activation logs This command polls continuously for log messages. If you go ahead and submit a message in the app, all the actions will show up here together with their log messages.\nTo also check if there are some problems with your actions, run a couple of times ops activation list and check the Status of the activations. If you see some developer error or any other errors, just grab the activation ID and run ops logs \u003cactivation ID\u003e.\n","categories":"","description":"Sending notifications on user interaction","excerpt":"Sending notifications on user interaction","ref":"/docs/tutorial/notify-message/","tags":"","title":"Sending notifications"},{"body":"Triggers Now let’s see what a trigger is and how to use it.\nWe can define a trigger as an object representing an event source that triggers the execution of actions. When activated by an event, associated actions are executed.\nIn other words, a trigger is a mechanism that listens for specific events or conditions and initiates actions in response to those events. It acts as the starting point for a workflow.\nExample: Sending Slack Notifications Let’s consider a scenario where we want to send Slack notifications when users visit specific pages and submit a contact form.\nStep 1: Define the Trigger We create a trigger named “PageVisitTrigger” that listens for events related to user visits on our website. To create it, you can use the following command:\nops trigger create PageVisitTrigger Once the trigger is created, you can update it to add parameters, such as the page parameter:\nops trigger update PageVisitTrigger --param page homepage 💡 NOTE\nOf course, there are not only create and update, but also delete, and they work as expected, updating and deleting triggers. In the next paragraph, we will also see the fire command, which requires you to first create rules to do something useful.\nStep 2: Associate the Trigger with an Action Next, we create an action named “SendSlackNotification” that sends a notification to Slack when invoked. Then, we associate this action with our “PageVisitTrigger” trigger, specifying that it should be triggered when users visit certain pages.\nTo associate the trigger with an action, you can use the following command:\nops rule create TriggerRule PageVisitTrigger SendSlackNotification We’ll have a better understanding of this aspect in Rules\nIn this example, whenever a user visits either the homepage or the contact page, the “SendSlackNotification” action will be triggered, resulting in a Slack notification being sent.\nConclusion Triggers provide a flexible and scalable way to automate workflows based on various events. By defining triggers and associating them with actions, you can create powerful applications that respond dynamically to user interactions, system events, or any other specified conditions.\n","categories":"","description":"Event source that triggers an action execution","excerpt":"Event source that triggers an action execution","ref":"/docs/cli/entities/triggers/","tags":"","title":"Triggers"},{"body":"App Deployment Deploy Apache OpenServerless makes publishing a project a very simple operation.

Let’s create, inside the packages folder, two files:\n01-actions.yaml 02-sequences.yaml We’ll do so, because actions are required to deploy sequences.\nThe directory structure should be like this:\ncontact_us_app ├── packages │ ├── 01-actions.yaml │ ├── 02-sequences.yaml │ └── contact │ ├── create-table.js │ ├── notify.js │ ├── submit.js │ └── write.js └── web └── index.html The Action Manifest File Inside the 01-actions.yaml put this content:\npackages: contact: inputs: POSTGRES_URL: type: string value: $POSTGRES_URL actions: submit: function: contact/submit.js web: true write: function: contact/write.js web: true notify: function: contact/notify.js web: true inputs: NOTIFICATION_URL: type: string value: $NOTIFICATION_URL create-table: function: contact/create-table.js At the top level we have the standard packages keyword, under which we can define the packages we want. Until now we created all of our actions in the contact package so we add it under packages.\nThen under each package, the actions keyword is needed so we can add our action custom names with the path to the code (with function). Finally we also add web: true which is equivalent to --web true when creating the action manually.\nFinally we used the inputs keyword to define the parameters to inject in the function.\nThis file will be automatically deployed by the ops ide deploy command.\nThe Sequences Manifest File Inside the 01-actions.yaml put this content:\npackages: contact: sequences: submit-write: actions: submit, write web: true submit-notify: actions: submit-write, notify web: true At the top level we define the packages keyword and immediately after, the contact package.

However, the fastest way to develop a new, compliant runtime is by reusing the ActionLoop proxy which already implements most of the specification and requires you to write code for just a few hooks to get a fully functional (and fast) runtime in a few hours or less.\nWhat is the ActionLoop proxy The ActionLoop proxy is a runtime “engine”, written in the Go programming language, originally developed specifically to support the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless Go language runtime. However, it was written in a generic way such that it has since been adopted to implement OpenWhisk and OpenServerless runtimes for Swift, PHP, Python, Rust, Java, Ruby and Crystal. Even though it was developed with compiled languages in mind it works equally well with scripting languages.\nUsing it, you can develop a new runtime in a fraction of the time needed for authoring a full-fledged runtime from scratch. This is due to the fact that you have only to write a command line protocol and not a fully-featured web server (with a small amount of corner cases to consider). The results should also produce a runtime that is fairly fast and responsive. In fact, the ActionLoop proxy has also been adopted to improve the performance of existing runtimes like Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java where performance has improved by a factor between 2x to 20x.\nPrecompilation of OpenWhisk and OpenServerless Actions In addition to being the basis for new runtime development, ActionLoop runtimes can also support offline “precompilation” of OpenWhisk and OpenServerless Action source files into a ZIP file that contains only the compiled binaries which are very fast to start once deployed. More information on this approach can be found here: Precompiling Go Sources Offline which describes how to do this for the Go language, but the approach applies to any language supported by ActionLoop.\nTutorial - How to write a new runtime with the ActionLoop Proxy This section contains a stepwise tutorial which will take you through the process of developing a new ActionLoop runtime using the Ruby language as the example.\nGeneral development process The general procedure for authoring a runtime with the ActionLoop proxy requires the following steps:\nbuilding a docker image containing your target language compiler and the ActionLoop runtime.\nwriting a simple line-oriented protocol in your target language.\nwriting a compilation script for your target language.\nwriting some mandatory tests for your language.\nActionLoop Starter Kit To facilitate the process, there is an actionloop-starter-kit in the openwhisk-devtools GitHub repository, that implements a fully working runtime for Python. It contains a stripped-down version of the real Python runtime (with some advanced features removed) along with guided, step-by-step instructions on how to translate it to a different target runtime language using Ruby as an example.\nIn short, the starter kit provides templates you can adapt in creating an ActionLoop runtime for each of the steps listed above, these include :\n-checking out the actionloop-starter-kit from the openwhisk-devtools repository -editing the Dockerfile to create the target environment for your target language. -converting (rewrite) the launcher.py script to an equivalent for script for your target language. -editing the compile script to compile your action in your target language. -writing the mandatory tests for your target language, by adapting the ActionLoopPythonBasicTests.scala file.\nAs a starting language, we chose Python since it is one of the more human-readable languages (can be treated as pseudo-code). Do not worry, you should only need just enough Python knowledge to be able to rewrite launcher.py and edit the compile script for your target language.\nFinally, you will need to update the ActionLoopPythonBasicTests.scala test file which, although written in the Scala language, only serves as a wrapper that you will use to embed your target language tests into.\nNotation In each step of this tutorial, we typically show snippets of either terminal transcripts (i.e., commands and results) or “diffs” of changes to existing code files.\nWithin terminal transcript snippets, comments are prefixed with # character and commands are prefixed by the $ character. Lines that follow commands may include sample output (from their execution) which can be used to verify against results in your local environment.\nWhen snippets show changes to existing source files, lines without a prefix should be left “as is”, lines with - should be removed and lines with + should be added.\nPrerequisites Docker engine - please have a valid docker engine installed that supports multi-stage builds (i.e., Docker 17.05 or higher) and assure the Docker daemon is running. # Verify docker version $ docker --version Docker version 18.09.3 # Verify docker is running $ docker ps # The result should be a valid response listing running processes Setup the development directory So let’s start to create our own actionloop-demo-ruby-2.6 runtime. First, check out the devtools repository to access the starter kit, then move it in your home directory to work on it.\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/openwhisk-devtools mv openwhisk-devtools/actionloop-starter-kit ~/actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6 Now, take the directory python3.7 and rename it to ruby2.6 and use sed to fix the directory name references in the Gradle build files.\ncd ~/actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6 mv python3.7 ruby2.6 sed -i.bak -e 's/python3.7/ruby2.6/' settings.gradle sed -i.bak -e 's/actionloop-demo-python-v3.7/actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6/' ruby2.6/build.gradle Let’s check everything is fine building the image.\n# building the image $ ./gradlew distDocker # ... intermediate output omitted ... BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s 2 actionable tasks: 2 executed # checking the image is available $ docker images actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6 REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6 latest df3e77c9cd8f 2 minutes ago 94.3MB At this point, we have built a new image named actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6. However, despite having Ruby in the name, internally it still is a Python language runtime which we will need to change to one supporting Ruby as we continue in this tutorial.\nPreparing the Docker environment Our language runtime’s Dockerfile has the task of preparing an environment for executing OpenWhisk and OpenServerless Actions. Using the ActionLoop approach, we use a multistage Docker build to\nderive our OpenWhisk and OpenServerless language runtime from an existing Docker image that has all the target language’s tools and libraries for running functions authored in that language.\nIn our case, we will reference the ruby:2.6.2-alpine3.9 image from the Official Docker Images for Ruby on Docker Hub. leverage the existing openwhisk/actionlooop-v2 image on Docker Hub from which we will “extract” the ActionLoop proxy (i.e. copy /bin/proxy binary) our runtime will use to process Activation requests from the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform and execute Actions by using the language’s tools and libraries from step #1.\nRepurpose the renamed Python Dockerfile for Ruby builds Let’s edit the ruby2.6/Dockerfile to use the official Ruby image on Docker Hub as our base image, instead of a Python image, and add our our Ruby launcher script:\nFROM openwhisk/actionloop-v2:latest as builder -FROM python:3.7-alpine +FROM ruby:2.6.2-alpine3.9 RUN mkdir -p /proxy/bin /proxy/lib /proxy/action WORKDIR /proxy COPY --from=builder /bin/proxy /bin/proxy -ADD lib/launcher.py /proxy/lib/launcher.py +ADD lib/launcher.rb /proxy/lib/launcher.rb ADD bin/compile /proxy/bin/compile +RUN apk update \u0026\u0026 apk add python3 ENV OW_COMPILER=/proxy/bin/compile ENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/proxy\"] Next, let’s rename the launcher.py (a Python script) to one that indicates it is a Ruby script named launcher.rb.\nmv ruby2.6/lib/launcher.py ruby2.6/lib/launcher.rb Note that:\nYou changed the base Docker image to use a Ruby language image.\nYou changed the launcher script from Python to Ruby.\nWe had to add a python3 package to our Ruby image since our compile script will be written in Python for this tutorial. Of course, you may choose to rewrite the compile script in Ruby if you wish to as your own exercise.\nImplementing the ActionLoop protocol This section will take you through how to convert the contents of launcher.rb (formerly launcher.py) to the target Ruby programming language and implement the ActionLoop protocol.\nWhat the launcher needs to do Let’s recap the steps the launcher must accomplish to implement the ActionLoop protocol :\nimport the Action function’s main method for execution.\nNote: the compile script will make the function available to the launcher. open the system’s file descriptor 3 which will be used to output the functions response.\nread the system’s standard input, stdin, line-by-line. Each line is parsed as a JSON string and produces a JSON object (not an array nor a scalar) to be passed as the input arg to the function.\nNote: within the JSON object, the value key contains the user parameter data to be passed to your functions. All the other keys are made available as process environment variables to the function; these need to be uppercased and prefixed with \"__OW_\". invoke the main function with the JSON object payload.\nencode the result of the function in JSON (ensuring it is only one line and it is terminated with one newline) and write it to file descriptor 3.\nOnce the function returns the result, flush the contents of stdout, stderr and file descriptor 3 (FD 3).\nFinally, include the above steps in a loop so that it continually looks for Activations. That’s it.\nConverting launcher script to Ruby Now, let’s look at the protocol described above, codified within the launcher script launcher.rb, and work to convert its contents from Python to Ruby.\nImport the function code Skipping the first few library import statements within launcer.rb, which we will have to resolve later after we determine which ones Ruby may need, we see the first significant line of code importing the actual Action function.\n# now import the action as process input/output from main__ import main as main In Ruby, this can be rewritten as:\n# requiring user's action code require \"./main__\" Note that you are free to decide the path and filename for the function’s source code. In our examples, we chose a base filename that includes the word \"main\" (since it is OpenWhisk and OpenServerless default function name) and append two underscores to better assure uniqueness.\nOpen File Descriptor (FD) 3 for function results output The ActionLoop proxy expects to read the results of invoking the Action function from File Descriptor (FD) 3.\nThe existing Python:\nout = fdopen(3, \"wb\") would be rewritten in Ruby as:\nout = IO.new(3) Process Action’s arguments from STDIN Each time the function is invoked via an HTTP request, the ActionLoop proxy passes the message contents to the launcher via STDIN. The launcher must read STDIN line-by-line and parse it as JSON.\nThe launcher’s existing Python code reads STDIN line-by-line as follows:\nwhile True: line = stdin.readline() if not line: break # ...continue... would be translated to Ruby as follows:\nwhile true # JSON arguments get passed via STDIN line = STDIN.gets() break unless line # ...continue... end Each line is parsed in JSON, where the payload is extracted from contents of the \"value\" key. Other keys and their values are as uppercased, \"__OW_\" prefixed environment variables:\nThe existing Python code for this is:\n# ... continuing ... args = json.loads(line) payload = {} for key in args: if key == \"value\": payload = args[\"value\"] else: os.environ[\"__OW_%s\" % key.upper()]= args[key] # ... continue ... would be translated to Ruby:\n# ... continuing ... args = JSON.parse(line) payload = {} args.each do |key, value| if key == \"value\" payload = value else # set environment variables for other keys ENV[\"__OW_#{key.upcase}\"] = value end end # ... continue ... Invoking the Action function We are now at the point of invoking the Action function and producing its result. Note we must also capture exceptions and produce an {\"error\": \u003cresult\u003e } if anything goes wrong during execution.\nThe existing Python code for this is:\n# ... continuing ... res = {} try: res = main(payload) except Exception as ex: print(traceback.format_exc(), file=stderr) res = {\"error\": str(ex)} # ... continue ... would be translated to Ruby:\n# ... continuing ... res = {} begin res = main(payload) rescue Exception =\u003e e puts \"exception: #{e}\" res [\"error\"] = \"#{e}\" end # ... continue ... Finalize File Descriptor (FD) 3, STDOUT and STDERR Finally, we need to write the function’s result to File Descriptor (FD) 3 and “flush” standard out (stdout), standard error (stderr) and FD 3.\nThe existing Python code for this is:\nout.write(json.dumps(res, ensure_ascii=False).encode('utf-8')) out.write(b'\\n') stdout.flush() stderr.flush() out.flush() would be translated to Ruby:\nSTDOUT.flush() STDERR.flush() out.puts(res.to_json) out.flush() Congratulations! You just completed your ActionLoop request handler.\nWriting the compilation script Now, we need to write the compilation script. It is basically a script that will prepare the uploaded sources for execution, adding the launcher code and generate the final executable.\nFor interpreted languages, the compilation script will only “prepare” the sources for execution. The executable is simply a shell script to invoke the interpreter.\nFor compiled languages, like Go it will actually invoke a compiler in order to produce the final executable. There are also cases like Java where we still need to execute the compilation step that produces intermediate code, but the executable is just a shell script that will launch the Java runtime.\nHow the ActionLoop proxy handles action uploads The OpenWhisk and OpenServerless user can upload actions with the ops Command Line Interface (CLI) tool as a single file.\nThis single file can be:\na source file\nan executable file\na ZIP file containing sources\na ZIP file containing an executable and other support files\nImportant: an executable for ActionLoop is either a Linux binary (an ELF executable) or a script. A script is, using Linux conventions, is anything starting with #!. The first line is interpreted as the command to use to launch the script: #!/bin/bash, #!/usr/bin/python etc.\nThe ActionLoop proxy accepts any file, prepares a work folder, with two folders in it named \"src\" and \"bin\". Then it detects the format of the uploaded file. For each case, the behavior is different.\nIf the uploaded file is an executable, it is stored as bin/exec and executed.\nIf the uploaded file is not an executable and not a zip file, it is stored as src/exec then the compilation script is invoked.\nIf the uploaded file is a zip file, it is unzipped in the src folder, then the src/exec file is checked.\nIf it exists and it is an executable, the folder src is renamed to bin and then again the bin/exec is executed.\nIf the src/exec is missing or is not an executable, then the compiler script is invoked.\nCompiling an action in source format The compilation script is invoked only when the upload contains sources. According to the description in the past paragraph, if the upload is a single file, we can expect the file is in src/exec, without any prefix. Otherwise, sources are spread the src folder and it is the task of the compiler script to find the sources. A runtime may impose that when a zip file is uploaded, then there should be a fixed file with the main function. For example, the Python runtime expects the file __main__.py. However, it is not a rule: the Go runtime does not require any specific file as it compiles everything. It only requires a function with the name specified.\nThe compiler script goal is ultimately to leave in bin/exec an executable (implementing the ActionLoop protocol) that the proxy can launch. Also, if the executable is not standalone, other files must be stored in this folder, since the proxy can also zip all of them and send to the user when using the pre-compilation feature.\nThe compilation script is a script pointed by the OW_COMPILER environment variable (you may have noticed it in the Dockerfile) that will be invoked with 3 parameters:\n\u003cmain\u003e is the name of the main function specified by the user on the ops command line\n\u003csrc\u003e is the absolute directory with the sources already unzipped\nan empty \u003cbin\u003e directory where we are expected to place our final executables\nNote that both the \u003csrc\u003e and \u003cbin\u003e are disposable, so we can do things like removing the \u003cbin\u003e folder and rename the \u003csrc\u003e.\nSince the user generally only sends a function specified by the \u003cmain\u003e parameter, we have to add the launcher we wrote and adapt it to execute the function.\nImplementing the compile for Ruby This is the algorithm that the compile script in the kit follows for Python:\nif there is a \u003csrc\u003e/exec it must rename to the main file; I use the name main__.py\nif there is a \u003csrc\u003e/__main__.py it will rename to the main file main__.py\ncopy the launcher.py to exec__.py, replacing the main(arg) with \u003cmain\u003e(arg); this file imports the main__.py and invokes the function \u003cmain\u003e\nadd a launcher script \u003csrc\u003e/exec\nfinally it removes the \u003cbin\u003e folder and rename \u003csrc\u003e to \u003cbin\u003e\nWe can adapt this algorithm easily to Ruby with just a few changes.\nThe script defines the functions sources and build then starts the execution, at the end of the script.\nStart from the end of the script, where the script collect parameters from the command line. Instead of launcher.py, use launcher.rb:\n- launcher = \"%s/lib/launcher.py\" % dirname(dirname(sys.argv[0])) + launcher = \"%s/lib/launcher.rb\" % dirname(dirname(sys.argv[0])) Then the script invokes the source function. This function renames the exec file to main__.py, you will rename it instead to main__.rb:\n- copy_replace(src_file, \"%s/main__.py\" % src_dir) + copy_replace(src_file, \"%s/main__.rb\" % src_dir) If instead there is a __main__.py the function will rename to main__.py (the launcher invokes this file always). The Ruby runtime will use a main.rb as starting point. So the next change is:\n- # move __main__ in the right place if it exists - src_file = \"%s/__main__.py\" % src_dir + # move main.rb in the right place if it exists + src_file = \"%s/main.rb\" % src_dir Now, the source function copies the launcher as exec__.py, replacing the line from main__ import main as main (invoking the main function) with from main__ import \u003cmain\u003e as main. In Ruby you may want to replace the line res = main(payload) with res = \u003cmain\u003e(payload). In code it is:\n- copy_replace(launcher, \"%s/exec__.py\" % src_dir, - \"from main__ import main as main\", - \"from main__ import %s as main\" % main ) + copy_replace(launcher, \"%s/exec__.rb\" % src_dir, + \"res = main(payload)\", + \"res = %s(payload)\" % main ) We are almost done. We just need the startup script that instead of invoking python will invoke Ruby. So in the build function do this change:\nwrite_file(\"%s/exec\" % tgt_dir, \"\"\"#!/bin/sh cd \"$(dirname $0)\" -exec /usr/local/bin/python exec__.py +exec ruby exec__.rb \"\"\") For an interpreted language that is all. We move the src folder in the bin. For a compiled language instead, we may want to actually invoke the compiler to produce the executable.\nDebugging Now that we have completed both the launcher and compile scripts, it is time to test them.\nHere we will learn how to:\nenter in a test environment\nsimple smoke tests to check things work\nwriting the validation tests\ntesting the image in an actual OpenWhisk and OpenServerless environment\nEntering in the test environment In the starter kit, there is a Makefile that can help with our development efforts.\nWe can build the Dockerfile using the provided Makefile. Since it has a reference to the image we are building, let’s change it:\nsed -i.bak -e 's/actionloop-demo-python-v3.7/actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6/' ruby2.6/Makefile We should be now able to build the image and enter in it with make debug. It will rebuild the image for us and put us into a shell so we can enter access the image environment for testing and debugging:\n$ cd ruby2.6 $ make debug # results omitted for brevity ... Let’s start with a couple of notes about this test environment.\nFirst, use --entrypoint=/bin/sh when starting the image to have a shell available at our image entrypoint. Generally, this is true by default; however, in some stripped down base images a shell may not be available.\nSecond, the /proxy folder is mounted in our local directory, so that we can edit the bin/compile and the lib/launcher.rb using our editor outside the Docker image\nNOTE It is not necessary to rebuild the Docker image with every change when using make debug since directories and environment variables used by the proxy indicate where the code outside the Docker container is located.\nOnce at the shell prompt that we will use for development, we will have to start and stop the proxy. The shell will help us to inspect what happened inside the container.\nA simple smoke test It is time to test. Let’s write a very simple test first, converting the example\\hello.py in example\\hello.rb to appear as follows:\ndef hello(args) name = args[\"name\"] || \"stranger\" greeting = \"Hello #{name}!\" puts greeting { \"greeting\" =\u003e greeting } end Now change into the ruby2.6 subdirectory of our runtime project and in one terminal type:\n$ cd \u003cprojectdir\u003e/ruby2.6 $ make debug # results omitted for brevity ... # (you should see a shell prompt of your image) $ /bin/proxy -debug 2019/04/08 07:47:36 OpenWhisk and OpenServerless ActionLoop Proxy 2: starting Now the runtime is started in debug mode, listening on port 8080, and ready to accept Action deployments.\nOpen another terminal (while leaving the first one running the proxy) and go into the top-level directory of our project to test the Action by executing an init and then a couple of run requests using the tools/invoke.py test script.\nThese steps should look something like this in the second terminal:\n$ cd \u003cprojectdir\u003e $ python tools/invoke.py init hello example/hello.rb {\"ok\":true} $ python tools/invoke.py run '{}' {\"greeting\":\"Hello stranger!\"} $ python tools/invoke.py run '{\"name\":\"Mike\"}' {\"greeting\":\"Hello Mike!\"} We should also see debug output from the first terminal running the proxy (with the debug flag) which should have successfully processed the init and run requests above.\nThe proxy’s debug output should appear something like:\n/proxy # /bin/proxy -debug 2019/04/08 07:54:57 OpenWhisk and OpenServerless ActionLoop Proxy 2: starting 2019/04/08 07:58:00 compiler: /proxy/bin/compile 2019/04/08 07:58:00 it is source code 2019/04/08 07:58:00 compiling: ./action/16/src/exec main: hello 2019/04/08 07:58:00 compiling: /proxy/bin/compile hello action/16/src action/16/bin 2019/04/08 07:58:00 compiler out: , \u003cnil\u003e 2019/04/08 07:58:00 env: [__OW_API_HOST=] 2019/04/08 07:58:00 starting ./action/16/bin/exec 2019/04/08 07:58:00 Start: 2019/04/08 07:58:00 pid: 13 2019/04/08 07:58:24 done reading 13 bytes Hello stranger!

XXX_THE_END_OF_A_WHISK_ACTIVATION_XXX XXX_THE_END_OF_A_WHISK_ACTIVATION_XXX 2019/04/08 07:58:54 received::{\"greeting\":\"Hello Mike!\"} Hints and tips for debugging Of course, it is very possible something went wrong. Here a few debugging suggestions:\nThe ActionLoop runtime (proxy) can only be initialized once using the init command from the invoke.py script. If we need to re-initialize the runtime, we need to stop the runtime (i.e., with Control-C) and restart it.\nWe can also check what is in the action folder. The proxy creates a numbered folder under action and then a src and bin folder.\nFor example, using a terminal window, we would would see a directory and file structure created by a single action:\n$ find action/ action/1 action/1/bin action/1/bin/exec__.rb action/1/bin/exec action/1/bin/main__.rb Note that the exec starter, exec__.rb launcher and main__.rb action code are have all been copied under a directory numbered`1`.\nIn addition, we can try to run the action directly and see if it behaves properly:\n$ cd action/1/bin $ ./exec 3\u003e\u00261 $ {\"value\":{\"name\":\"Mike\"}} Hello Mike! {\"greeting\":\"Hello Mike!\"} Note we redirected the file descriptor 3 in stdout to check what is happening, and note that logs appear in stdout too.\nAlso, we can test the compiler invoking it directly.\nFirst let’s prepare the environment as it appears when we just uploaded the action:\n$ cd /proxy $ mkdir -p action/2/src action/2/bin $ cp action/1/bin/main__.rb action/2/src/exec $ find action/2 action/2 action/2/bin action/2/src action/2/src/exec Now compile and examine the results again:\n$ /proxy/bin/compile main action/2/src action/2/bin $ find action/2 action/2/ action/2/bin action/2/bin/exec__.rb action/2/bin/exec action/2/bin/main__.rb Testing If we have reached this point in the tutorial, the runtime is able to run and execute a simple test action. Now we need to validate the runtime against a set of mandatory tests both locally and within an OpenWhisk and OpenServerless staging environment. Additionally, we should author and automate additional tests for language specific features and styles.\nThe starter kit includes two handy makefiles that we can leverage for some additional tests. In the next sections, we will show how to update them for testing our Ruby runtime.\nTesting multi-file Actions So far we tested a only an Action comprised of a single file. We should also test multi-file Actions (i.e., those with relative imports) sent to the runtime in both source and binary formats.\nFirst, let’s try a multi-file Action by creating a Ruby Action script named example/main.rb that invokes our hello.rb as follows:\nrequire \"./hello\" def main(args) hello(args) end Within the example/Makefile makefile:\nupdate the name of the image to ruby-v2.6\" as well as the name of the main action.\nupdate the PREFIX with your DockerHub username.\n-IMG=actionloop-demo-python-v3.7:latest -ACT=hello-demo-python -PREFIX=docker.io/openwhisk +IMG=actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6:latest +ACT=hello-demo-ruby +PREFIX=docker.io/\u003cdocker username\u003e Now, we are ready to test the various cases. Again, start the runtime proxy in debug mode:\ncd ruby2.6 make debug /bin/proxy -debug On another terminal, try to deploy a single file:\n$ make test-single python ../tools/invoke.py init hello ../example/hello.rb {\"ok\":true} python ../tools/invoke.py run '{}' {\"greeting\":\"Hello stranger!\"} python ../tools/invoke.py run '{\"name\":\"Mike\"}' {\"greeting\":\"Hello Mike!\"} Now, stop and restart the proxy and try to send a ZIP file with the sources:\n$ make test-src-zip zip src.zip main.rb hello.rb adding: main.rb (deflated 42%) adding: hello.rb (deflated 42%) python ../tools/invoke.py init ../example/src.zip {\"ok\":true} python ../tools/invoke.py run '{}' {\"greeting\":\"Hello stranger!\"} python ../tools/invoke.py run '{\"name\":\"Mike\"}' {\"greeting\":\"Hello Mike!\"} Finally, test the pre-compilation: the runtime builds a zip file with the sources ready to be deployed. Again, stop and restart the proxy then:\n$ make test-bin-zip docker run -i actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6:latest -compile main \u003csrc.zip \u003ebin.zip python ../tools/invoke.py init ../example/bin.zip {\"ok\":true} python ../tools/invoke.py run '{}' {\"greeting\":\"Hello stranger!\"} python ../tools/invoke.py run '{\"name\":\"Mike\"}' {\"greeting\":\"Hello Mike!\"} Congratulations! The runtime works locally! Time to test it on the public cloud. So as the last step before moving forward, let’s push the image to Docker Hub with make push.\nTesting on OpenWhisk and OpenServerless To run this test you need to configure access to OpenWhisk and OpenServerless with ops. A simple way is to get access is to register a free account in the IBM Cloud but this works also with our own deployment of OpenWhisk and OpenServerless.\nEdit the Makefile as we did previously:\nIMG=actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6:latest ACT=hello-demo-ruby PREFIX=docker.io/\u003cdocker username\u003e Also, change any reference to hello.py and main.py to hello.rb and main.rb.\nOnce this is done, we can re-run the tests we executed locally on “the real thing”.\nTest single:\n$ make test-single ops action update hello-demo-ruby hello.rb --docker docker.io/linus/actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6:latest --main hello ok: updated action hello-demo-ruby ops action invoke hello-demo-ruby -r { \"greeting\": \"Hello stranger!\" } ops action invoke hello-demo-ruby -p name Mike -r { \"greeting\": \"Hello Mike!\" } Test source zip:\n$ make test-src-zip zip src.zip main.rb hello.rb adding: main.rb (deflated 42%) adding: hello.rb (deflated 42%) ops action update hello-demo-ruby src.zip --docker docker.io/linus/actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6:latest ok: updated action hello-demo-ruby ops action invoke hello-demo-ruby -r { \"greeting\": \"Hello stranger!\" } ops action invoke hello-demo-ruby -p name Mike -r { \"greeting\": \"Hello Mike!\" } Test binary ZIP:\n$ make test-bin-zip docker run -i actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6:latest -compile main \u003csrc.zip \u003ebin.zip ops action update hello-demo-ruby bin.zip --docker docker.io/actionloop/actionloop-demo-ruby-v2.6:latest ok: updated action hello-demo-ruby ops action invoke hello-demo-ruby -r { \"greeting\": \"Hello stranger!\" } ops action invoke hello-demo-ruby -p name Mike -r { \"greeting\": \"Hello Mike!\" } Congratulations! Your runtime works also in the real world.\nWriting the validation tests Before you can submit your runtime you should ensure your runtime pass the validation tests.\nUnder tests/src/test/scala/runtime/actionContainers/ActionLoopPythonBasicTests.scala there is the template for the test.\nRename to tests/src/test/scala/runtime/actionContainers/ActionLoopRubyBasicTests.scala, change internally the class name to class ActionLoopRubyBasicTests and implement the following test cases:\ntestNotReturningJson\ntestUnicode\ntestEnv\ntestInitCannotBeCalledMoreThanOnce\ntestEntryPointOtherThanMain\ntestLargeInput\nYou should convert Python code to Ruby code. We do not do go into the details of each test, as they are pretty simple and obvious. You can check the source code for the real test here.\nYou can verify tests are running properly with:\n$ ./gradlew test Starting a Gradle Daemon, 1 busy Daemon could not be reused, use --status for details \u003e Task :tests:test runtime.actionContainers.ActionLoopPythoRubyTests \u003e runtime proxy should handle initialization with no code PASSED runtime.actionContainers.ActionLoopPythoRubyTests \u003e runtime proxy should handle initialization with no content PASSED runtime.actionContainers.ActionLoopPythoRubyTests \u003e runtime proxy should run and report an error for function not returning a json object PASSED runtime.actionContainers.ActionLoopPythoRubyTests \u003e runtime proxy should fail to initialize a second time PASSED runtime.actionContainers.ActionLoopPythoRubyTests \u003e runtime proxy should invoke non-standard entry point PASSED runtime.actionContainers.ActionLoopPythoRubyTests \u003e runtime proxy should echo arguments and print message to stdout/stderr PASSED runtime.actionContainers.ActionLoopPythoRubyTests \u003e runtime proxy should handle unicode in source, input params, logs, and result PASSED runtime.actionContainers.ActionLoopPythoRubyTests \u003e runtime proxy should confirm expected environment variables PASSED runtime.actionContainers.ActionLoopPythoRubyTests \u003e runtime proxy should echo a large input PASSED BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 55s Big congratulations are in order having reached this point successfully. At this point, our runtime should be ready to run on any OpenWhisk and OpenServerless platform and also can be submitted for consideration to be included in the Apache OpenWhisk and OpenServerless project.\n","categories":"","description":"How to implement your runtime from scratch","excerpt":"How to implement your runtime from scratch","ref":"/docs/reference/references/actions-actionloop/","tags":"","title":"Building your runtime"},{"body":"OpenWhisk and OpenServerless support an open API, where any user can expose an event producer service as a feed in a package. This section describes architectural and implementation options for providing your own feed.\nThis material is intended for advanced OpenWhisk and OpenServerless users who intend to publish their own feeds. Most OpenWhisk and OpenServerless users can safely skip this section.\nFeed Architecture There are at least 3 architectural patterns for creating a feed: Hooks, Polling and Connections.\nHooks In the Hooks pattern, we set up a feed using a webhook facility exposed by another service. In this strategy, we configure a webhook on an external service to POST directly to a URL to fire a trigger. This is by far the easiest and most attractive option for implementing low-frequency feeds.\nPolling In the Polling pattern, we arrange for an OpenWhisk and OpenServerless action to poll an endpoint periodically to fetch new data. This pattern is relatively easy to build, but the frequency of events will of course be limited by the polling interval.\nConnections In the Connections pattern, we stand up a separate service somewhere that maintains a persistent connection to a feed source. The connection based implementation might interact with a service endpoint via long polling, or to set up a push notification.\nDifference between Feed and Trigger Feeds and triggers are closely related, but technically distinct concepts.\nOpenWhisk and OpenServerless process events which flow into the system.\nA trigger is technically a name for a class of events. Each event belongs to exactly one trigger; by analogy, a trigger resembles a topic in topic-based pub-sub systems. A rule T → A means “whenever an event from trigger T arrives, invoke action A with the trigger payload.\nA feed is a stream of events which all belong to some trigger T. A feed is controlled by a feed action which handles creating, deleting, pausing, and resuming the stream of events which comprise a feed. The feed action typically interacts with external services which produce the events, via a REST API that manages notifications.\nImplementing Feed Actions The feed action is a normal OpenWhisk and OpenServerless action, but it should accept the following parameters:\nlifecycleEvent: one of ‘CREATE’, ‘READ’, ‘UPDATE’, ‘DELETE’, ‘PAUSE’, or ‘UNPAUSE’. triggerName: the fully-qualified name of the trigger which contains events produced from this feed. authKey: the Basic auth credentials of the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless user who owns the trigger just mentioned. The feed action can also accept any other parameters it needs to manage the feed. For example the cloudant changes feed action expects to receive parameters including `dbname’, `username’, etc.\nWhen the user creates a trigger from the CLI with the –feed parameter, the system automatically invokes the feed action with the appropriate parameters.\nFor example, assume the user has created a mycloudant binding for the cloudant package with their username and password as bound parameters. When the user issues the following command from the CLI:\nops trigger create T --feed mycloudant/changes -p dbName myTable\nthen under the covers the system will do something equivalent to:\nops action invoke mycloudant/changes -p lifecycleEvent CREATE -p triggerName T -p authKey \u003cuserAuthKey\u003e -p password \u003cpassword value from mycloudant binding\u003e -p username \u003cusername value from mycloudant binding\u003e -p dbName mytype\nThe feed action named changes takes these parameters, and is expected to take whatever action is necessary to set up a stream of events from Cloudant, with the appropriate configuration, directed to the trigger T.\nFor the Cloudant changes feed, the action happens to talk directly to a cloudant trigger service we’ve implemented with a connection-based architecture. We’ll discuss the other architectures below.\nA similar feed action protocol occurs for ops trigger delete, ops trigger update and ops trigger get.\nImplementing Feeds with Hooks It is easy to set up a feed via a hook if the event producer supports a webhook/callback facility.\nWith this method there is no need to stand up any persistent service outside of OpenWhisk and OpenServerless. All feed management happens naturally though stateless OpenWhisk and OpenServerless feed actions, which negotiate directly with a third part webhook API.\nWhen invoked with CREATE, the feed action simply installs a webhook for some other service, asking the remote service to POST notifications to the appropriate fireTrigger URL in OpenWhisk and OpenServerless.\nThe webhook should be directed to send notifications to a URL such as:\nPOST /namespaces/{namespace}/triggers/{triggerName} The form with the POST request will be interpreted as a JSON document defining parameters on the trigger event. OpenWhisk and OpenServerless rules pass these trigger parameters to any actions to fire as a result of the event.\nImplementing Feeds with Polling It is possible to set up an OpenWhisk and OpenServerless action to poll a feed source entirely within OpenWhisk and OpenServerless, without the need to stand up any persistent connections or external service.\nFor feeds where a webhook is not available, but do not need high-volume or low latency response times, polling is an attractive option.\nTo set up a polling-based feed, the feed action takes the following steps when called for CREATE:\nThe feed action sets up a periodic trigger (T) with the desired frequency, using the whisk.system/alarms feed.\nThe feed developer creates a pollMyService action which simply polls the remote service and returns any new events.\nThe feed action sets up a rule T → pollMyService.\nThis procedure implements a polling-based trigger entirely using OpenWhisk and OpenServerless actions, without any need for a separate service.\nImplementing Feeds via Connections The previous 2 architectural choices are simple and easy to implement. However, if you want a high-performance feed, there is no substitute for persistent connections and long-polling or similar techniques.\nSince OpenWhisk and OpenServerless actions must be short-running, an action cannot maintain a persistent connection to a third party . Instead, we must stand up a separate service (outside of OpenWhisk and OpenServerless) that runs all the time. We call these provider services. A provider service can maintain connections to third party event sources that support long polling or other connection-based notifications.\nThe provider service should provide a REST API that allows the OpenWhisk and OpenServerless feed action to control the feed. The provider service acts as a proxy between the event provider and OpenWhisk and OpenServerless – when it receives events from the third party, it sends them on to OpenWhisk and OpenServerless by firing a trigger.\nThe connection-based architecture is the highest performance option, but imposes more overhead on operations compared to the polling and hook architectures.\n","categories":"","description":"Implement Feeds","excerpt":"Implement Feeds","ref":"/docs/reference/entities/feeds/","tags":"","title":"Feeds"},{"body":"Rules Once we have a trigger and some actions, we can create rules for the trigger. A rule connects the trigger with an action, so if you fire the trigger, it will invoke the action. Let’s see this in practice in the next listing.\nCreate data First of all, create a file called alert.js.\nfunction main() { console.log(\"Suspicious activity!\"); return { result: \"Suspicious activity!\" }; } Then, create a OpenServerless action for this file:\nops action create alert alert.js Now, create a trigger that we’ll call notifyAlert:\nops trigger create notifyAlert Now, all is ready, and now we can create our rule! The syntax follows this pattern: “ops rule create {ruleName} {triggerName} {actionName}”.\nops rule create alertRule notifyAlert alert Test your rule Our environment can now be alerted if something suspicious occurs! Before starting, let’s open another terminal window and enable polling (with the command ops activation poll) to see what happens.\n$ ops activation poll Enter Ctrl-c to exit.

Rules can also be enabled and disabled without removing them.

Built upon the robust Apache OpenWhisk framework, it aims to empower developers to create applications of any complexity, from simple forms to advanced AI-driven solutions.\nCurrently in its preview phase, Apache OpenServerless invites the community to provide feedback and contributions, accelerating its journey towards a stable release.\nKey Features of Apache OpenServerless Apache OpenServerless integrates three core components that collectively form a complete serverless ecosystem:\nServerless Engine Powered by Apache OpenWhisk At the heart of Apache OpenServerless lies Apache OpenWhisk, a distributed and scalable open-source platform for executing serverless functions. OpenWhisk enables dynamic execution of lightweight code snippets, or “Actions,” written in multiple programming languages. These Actions respond to events (via triggers) or HTTP requests, seamlessly adapting to various workloads.\nApplication Services To support various application needs, Apache OpenServerless provides a set of pre-configured services, including:\nan S3 compatible storage, a Redis compatible caching, MongoDB and PostgreSQL for both noSQL and SQL. Developer-Friendly Tools To streamline development, Apache OpenServerless offers:\nReady-to-use application templates - kickstarting projects for various use cases. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - the system offers a user-friendly CLI for seamless interaction with the serverless platform. Furthermore a VScode extension is available. Simplified deployment workflows - to build, test, and launch cloud-ready applications with ease. Installs everywhere and control data OpenServerless is trying to set new standards in the Function as a Service (FaaS) landscape. Built on Kubernetes and Apache OpenWhisk, OpenServerless offers an infrastructure-agnostic approach that can be installed on-premises or in public clouds. This flexibility ensures that data remains under the control of the organization, addressing key privacy concerns for industries with strict data governance requirements. By providing companies with the option to run their applications on their terms, OpenServerless aligns with the demand for transparent and secure data handling in a serverless environment.\nConclusion OpenServerless also benefits from the robust, scalable nature of Kubernetes, making it ideal for handling asynchronous, event-driven workloads that are core to modern serverless applications. With OpenWhisk’s powerful action-based execution model, it provides a straightforward framework for developers to deploy and manage functions seamlessly. The addition of observability tools allows developers to monitor performance, making it easy to optimize and troubleshoot.\nIn essence, OpenServerless is more than just a FaaS—it’s a privacy-focused, Kubernetes-native solution that empowers companies to innovate securely and effectively. With its unique approach to data control and its ability to support intensive workloads, OpenServerless is reshaping the serverless ecosystem and opening up exciting new applications for AI-powered, cloud-native solutions.\n","categories":"","description":"OpenServerless: Full-fledged open source FaaS, powered by Kubernetes and OpenWhisk  \n","excerpt":"OpenServerless: Full-fledged open source FaaS, powered by Kubernetes …","ref":"/blog/2024/11/16/apache-openserverless-a-faas-solution-with-privacy-and-power/","tags":"","title":"Apache OpenServerless: A FaaS Solution with Privacy and Power"},{"body":" OpenServerless is a complex project. It has a lot of moving parts and relies heavily on Kubernetes.\nThere are many subprojects, and each subproject has a complex set of dependencies. Setting up all those dependencies is usually complex and time consuming.\nI have worked in a project where it used to take literally a couple of days to get everything ready to code. Also, you were never sure that everything was set up correctly because the dependencies were constantly changing.\nFor this reason, we have made a special effort to provide an easy and consistent way to have a standardized development environment for OpenServerless.\nThe Development Virtual Machine We considered a few options for setting up the development environment.\nThe first option is of course a setup script, but since you may be working on Linux, Windows or Mac, this approach turns out to be difficult and fragile.\nThe second option is to use Docker, and indeed for a while we used a Docker image in DevContainer format as our development environment. We also set up a Kubernetes development cluster using Kind, that is, “Kubernetes-in-Docker”.\nHowever, this approach proved to be slow and with a number of problems related to Docker. So we gradually moved to using a full virtual machine. And this is the approach we are taking with OpenServerless.\nThe development environment is a virtual machine initialized with a cloud-init script. Cloud-init is a standard for initializing a virtual machine in the cloud.\nUsing this cloud-init script you can actually run a developmnt environment basically in any cloud provider, if you want a shared one.\nOr, if you want to use your local machine, assuming you have at least 16GB of memory, you can launch the VM and initialize it with Cloud-Init in Linux, Windows and Mac using multipass.\nTHe README of Apache OpenServerless is indeed entirely devoted to setup the development virtual machine with Multipass and Cloud-Init.\nWhat is in the development machine? Using this cloud-init script, you can actually run a development environment in basically any cloud provider if you want a shared one.\nOr if you want to use your local machine, assuming you have at least 16GB of memory, you can start the VM and initialize it with cloud-init in Linux, Windows and Mac using multipass.\nThe README for [Apache OpenServerless] (https://github.com/apache/openserverless) is actually entirely devoted to setting up the development virtual machine with Multipass and Cloud-Init.\nWhat is in the development machine? The development machine is actually packed with goodies. For a start, it includes Kubernetes in the form of K3S, a lightweight but full-featured version of Kubernetes. Well, technically, K3S is an API-compatible, work-alike sister re-implementation of Kubernetes, but for all practical purposes, it IS Kubernetes.\nBut we need more than Kubernetes. We have a number of subprojects, and for each one, there’s a different set of tools and programming languages that need to be set up. We used to have a script to setup these dependencies, but since it turned out to be tedious to update, we switched to using [the package manager Nix] (https://nixos.org/download/). This is a tool that allows you to set up development environments (actually any environment) declaratively by writing a script shell.nix, the Nix language that defines the development environment. The virtual machines also include nix, and also a tool called direnv to automatically configure nix, calling a different shell.nix every time you change a directory.\nLast but not least, we use VSCode as it provides remote development features and allows you to work in the virtual machine as if it were a local folder. Instructions for setting up VSCode to use the virtual machine are provided in the README.\nIt is also worth mentioning that since we use task a build tool everywhere, we included it in the VM. There is also a license manager license-eye to ensure that all files are properly licensed under the Apache license.\n","categories":"","description":"Our first code drop is available: the development environment!\n","excerpt":"Our first code drop is available: the development environment!\n","ref":"/blog/2024/07/12/assembling-the-lab-for-openserverless/","tags":"","title":"Assembling the lab for OpenServerless"},{"body":"The Apache OpenServerless project’s goal is to build a serverless distribution that runs in all major flavors of Kubernetes in public and private clouds, and in any virtual machine running Linux in any cloud.

Just press enter for default [nuvolaris]: *** Please, specify AKS number of worker nodes and press enter. Just press enter for default [3]: *** Please, specify AKS location and press enter. To get a list of valid values use: az account list-locations -o table Just press enter for default [eastus]: *** Please, specify AKS virtual machine type and press enter. To get a list of valid values use: az vm list-sizes --location \u003clocation\u003e -o table where \u003clocation\u003e is your current location. Just press enter for default [Standard_B4ms]: *** Please, specify AKS disk size in gigabyte and press enter. Just press enter for default [50]: *** Please, specify AKS public SSH key in AWS and press enter. If you already have a public SSH key provide its path here. If you do not have it, generate a key pair with the following command: ssh-keygen The public key defaults to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Just press enter for default [~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub]: Provisioning Azure AKS Once you have configured it, you can create the AKS cluster with the command:\nops cloud aks create It will take around 10 minutes to be ready. Please be patient.\nAt the end of the process, you will have access directly to the created Kubernetes cluster for installation.\nRetrieving the Load Balancer DNS name Once the cluster is up and running, you need to retrieve the DNS name of the load balancer.\nYou can read this with the command:\nops cloud aks lb Take note of the result as it is required for configuring a dns name for your cluster.\nAdditional Commands You can delete the created cluster with: ops cloud aks delete\nYou can extract again the cluster configuration, if you lose it, reconfiguring the cluster and then using the command nuv cloud aks kubeconfig.\n","categories":"","description":"Prerequisites for Azure AKS","excerpt":"Prerequisites for Azure AKS","ref":"/docs/installation/prereq/kubernetes/aks/","tags":"","title":"Azure AKS"},{"body":"base64 utility acts as a base64 decoder when passed the --decode (or -d) flag and as a base64 encoder otherwise.

If you do so, only http is avaialble, and it is not secure.\nIf you want your server or cluster is available with a well-known internet name, you can associate the IP address or the “ugly” default DNS name of serveres or clusters to a DNS name of your choice, to use it also to publish the static front-end of your server.\nFurthermore, once you decided for a DNS name for your server, you can enable the provisioning of an SSL certificate so you server will be accessible with https.\nIn order to configure the DNS and the SSL the steps are:\nretrieve the IP address or the the DNS name of your server or cluster\nregister a DNS name of your choice with your registration name provider\nconfigure OpenServerless so he knows of the DNS and SSL and can use it\nRetrieving the IP address or the DNS name If OpenServerless is installed in your local machine with Docker, cannot configure any DNS nor SSL, so you can proceed configuring the services.\nIf OpenServerless is installed in a single server, after you satisfied the server prerequisites you will know the IP address or DNS name of you server.\nIf OpenServerless is installed in a Kubernetes cluster, after you satisfied the server cluster prerequisites you know either the IP address or the DNS name of the load balancer.\nRegister a DNS name or wildcard Using the address of your server or cluster, you need either to configure a DNS name your already own or contact a domain name registrar to register a new DNS name dedicated to your server or cluster.\nYou need at least one DNS name in a domain you control, for example nuvolaris.example.com that points to you IP or address.\nNote that:\nIf you have an IP address to your load balancer you need to configure an A record mapping nuvolaris.example.com to the IP address of your server.\nIf you have a DNS name to your load balancer, you need to configure a CNAME record mapping nuvolaris.example.com to the DNS name of your server.\n💡 NOTE\nIf you are registering a dedicated domain name for your cluster, you are advised to register wildcard name (*) for every domain name in example.com will resolve to your server.\nRegistering a wildcard is required to get a different website for for multiple users.\nConfigure OpenServerless to use your DNS and and enable SSL Once you registrered a single DNS (for example openserverless.example.com) or a wildcard DNS name (for example *.example.com) you can communicate to the installer what is the main DNS name of your cluster or server, as it is not able to detect it automatically. We call this the \u003capihost\u003e\n💡 NOTE\nIf you have registered a single DNS name, like openserverless.example.com use this name as \u003capihost\u003e.\nIf you have registered a wildcard DNS name, you have to choose a DNS name to be used as \u003capihost\u003e.\nWe recommended you use a name starting with api since to avoid clashes, user and domain names starting with api are reserved. So if you have a *.example.com wildcard DNS available, use api.example.com as your \u003capihost\u003e\nOnce you decided what is your API host, you can configure this as follows:\nops config apihost \u003capihost\u003e This configuration will assign a well know DNS name as access point of your OpenServerless cluster. However note it does NOT enable SSL. Accessing to your cluster will happen using HTTP.\nSince requests contain sensitive information like security keys, this is highly insecure. You hence do this only for development or testing but never for production.\nOnce you have a DNS name, enabling https is pretty easy, since we can do it automatically using the free service Let's Encrypt. We have however to provide a valid email address \u003cemail\u003e.\nOnce you know your \u003capihost\u003e and the \u003cemail\u003e to receive communications from Let’s Encrypt (mostly, when a domain name is invalidated and needs to be renewed), you can configure your apihost and enable SSL as follows:\nops config apihost \u003capihost\u003e --tls=\u003cemail\u003e Of course, replace the \u003capihost\u003e with the actual DNS name you registered, and \u003cemail\u003e with your email address\n","categories":"","description":"Configuring DNS and SSL","excerpt":"Configuring DNS and SSL","ref":"/docs/installation/configure/dns/","tags":"","title":"DNS and SSL"},{"body":"echoif is a utility that echoes the value of \u003ca\u003e if the exit code of the previous command is 0, echoes the value of \u003cb\u003e otherwise\nUsage: ops -echoif \u003ca\u003e \u003cb\u003e Example $( exit 1 ); ops -echoif \"0\" \"1\" 1 or\n$( exit 0 ); ops -echoif \"0\" \"1\" 0 ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"echoif is a utility that echoes the value of \u003ca\u003e if the exit code of …","ref":"/docs/reference/tools/echoif/","tags":"","title":"echoif"},{"body":"echoifempty is a utility that echoes the value of \u003ca\u003e if \u003cstr\u003e is empty, echoes the value of \u003cb\u003e otherwise.\nUsage: ops -echoifempty \u003cstr\u003e \u003ca\u003e \u003cb\u003e Example ops -echoifempty \"not empty string\" \"string is empty\" \"string is not empty\" ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"echoifempty is a utility that echoes the value of \u003ca\u003e if \u003cstr\u003e is …","ref":"/docs/reference/tools/echoifempty/","tags":"","title":"echoifempty"},{"body":"echoifexists is a utility that echoes the value of \u003ca\u003e if \u003cfile\u003e exists, echoes the value of \u003cb\u003e otherwise.\nUsage: ops -echoifexists \u003cfile\u003e \u003ca\u003e \u003cb\u003e Example ops -echoifexists \"exists\" \"doesn't exists\" ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"echoifexists is a utility that echoes the value of \u003ca\u003e if \u003cfile\u003e …","ref":"/docs/reference/tools/echoifexists/","tags":"","title":"echoifexists"},{"body":"Synopsis Usage: eks config eks create eks delete eks kubeconfig eks lb eks status Commands config configure an Amazon EKS cluster create create an Amazon EKS cluster delete delete the current Amazon EKS cluster kubeconfig extract kubeconfig for connecting to the cluster lb show the load balancer hostname prereq check prerequisites status show the cluster status ","categories":"","description":"Create and Manage an Amazon EKS cluster","excerpt":"Create and Manage an Amazon EKS cluster","ref":"/docs/reference/tasks/cloud/eks/","tags":"","title":"Eks"},{"body":"empty creates an empty file - returns error if it already exists.\nUsage: ops -empty \u003cfilename\u003e ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"empty creates an empty file - returns error if it already exists. …","ref":"/docs/reference/tools/empty/","tags":"","title":"empty"},{"body":"Synopsis Usage: env add \u003cargs\u003e... env remove \u003cargs\u003e... env list [--format=table|raw|json] Commands - add add or change one or multiple env to user metadata. ops env add VARA=valuea VARB=valueb - remove remove one or multiple env from user metadata. ops env remove VARA VARB - list list envs from user metadata Options --format Output data as table, as raw env or as json. default is table ","categories":"","description":"OpenServerless Env Utilities","excerpt":"OpenServerless Env Utilities","ref":"/docs/reference/tasks/env/","tags":"","title":"Env"},{"body":"executable make a file executable: on Unix-like systems it will do a chmod u+x.

In this case it installs K3S.\nBut you can install MicroK8S instead, if you prefer. Check here for informations about MicroK8S.\nIf you install MicroK8S in your server, you can then proceed configuring and then installing OpenServerless as in any other Kubernetes cluster.\nInstalling MicroK8S in a server Before installing ensure you have satisfied the prerequisites, most notably:\nyou know the IP address or DNS name\nyou have passwordless access with ssh\nyou have an user with passwordless sudo rights\nyou have opened the port 16443 in the firewall\nFurthermore, since MicroK8S is installed using snap, you also need to install snap.\n💡 NOTE\nWhile snap is available for many linux distributions, it is typically pre-installed and well supported in in Ubuntu and its derivatives. So we recommend MicroK8S only if you are actually using an Ubuntu-like Linux distribution.\nIf you system is suitable to run MicroK8S you can use the following subcommand to install in the server:\nops cloud mk8s create SERVER=\u003cserver\u003e USERNAME=\u003cusername\u003e where \u003cserver\u003e is IP address or DNS name to access the server, and \u003cusername\u003e is the user you use to access the server.\nThose informations should have been provided when provisioning the server.\n❗ IMPORTANT\nIf you installed a Kubernetes cluster in the server in this way, you should proceed installing OpenServerless as in a Kubernetes cluster, not as a server.\nThe installation retrieves also a kubernets configuration file so you can proceed to installing it without any other step involved.\nAdditional Commands In addition to create you have available also the following subcommands:\nops cloud mk8s delete SERVER=\u003cserver\u003e USERNAME=\u003cusername\u003e: uninstall K3S from the server\nops cloud mk8s kubeconfig SERVER=\u003cserver\u003e USERNAME=\u003cusername\u003e: retrieve the kubeconfig from the MicroK8S server\nops cloud mk8s info: informations about the server\nops cloud mk8s status: status of the server\n","categories":"","description":"Prerequisites to install OpenServerless in K8S","excerpt":"Prerequisites to install OpenServerless in K8S","ref":"/docs/installation/prereq/server/mk8s/","tags":"","title":"Install MicroK8S"},{"body":"Synopsis Usage: k3s create \u003cserver\u003e [\u003cuser\u003e] k3s delete \u003cserver\u003e [\u003cuser\u003e] k3s info k3s kubeconfig \u003cserver\u003e [\u003cuser\u003e] k3s status Commands create create a k3s with ssh in \u003cserver\u003e using \u003cuser\u003e with sudo delete uninstall k3s with ssh in \u003cserver\u003e using \u003cusername\u003e with sudo info info on the server kubeconfig recover the kubeconfig from a k3s server \u003cserver\u003e with user \u003cusername\u003e status status of the server ","categories":"","description":"Create and Manage K3S cluster","excerpt":"Create and Manage K3S cluster","ref":"/docs/reference/tasks/cloud/k3s/","tags":"","title":"K3s"},{"body":"Synopsis Usage: minio ls [--format=table|json] minio lsb \u003cbucket\u003e [--format=table|raw|json] minio rm \u003cbucket\u003e \u003cfile\u003e minio mv \u003cbucket\u003e \u003cfile\u003e \u003cdest_bucket\u003e \u003cdest_file\u003e minio cp \u003cbucket\u003e \u003cfile\u003e \u003cdest_bucket\u003e \u003cdest_file\u003e minio put \u003clocalfile\u003e \u003cbucket\u003e \u003cfile\u003e minio get \u003cbucket\u003e \u003cfile\u003e minio clean \u003cbucket\u003e [\u003cregexp\u003e] [--dryrun] Commands ls retrieve the list of all the user buckets lsb retrieve the content of the specified bucket (recursively) rm remove the given file from the specified bucket mv move a file from a bucket to another cp copy a file from a bucket to another put upload a localfile into the bucket/file get download a bucket file locally clean removes matching files (default pattern is .*) from the specified bucket (recursively) Options --format Output data as table or as json. default is json ","categories":"","description":"OpenServerless Minio/S3 Development Utilities.","excerpt":"OpenServerless Minio/S3 Development Utilities.","ref":"/docs/reference/tasks/devel/minio/","tags":"","title":"Minio"},{"body":"Synopsis Usage: mk8s create \u003cserver\u003e [\u003cuser\u003e] mk8s delete \u003cserver\u003e [\u003cuser\u003e] mk8s info mk8s kubeconfig \u003cserver\u003e [\u003cuser\u003e] mk8s status Commands create create a mk8s with ssh in \u003cserver\u003e using \u003cuser\u003e with sudo delete uninstall microk8s with ssh in \u003cserver\u003e using \u003cuser\u003e with sudo info info on the server kubeconfig recover the kubeconfig from a server \u003cserver\u003e with microk8s status status of the server ","categories":"","description":"Create and Manage an mk8s kubernetes cluster","excerpt":"Create and Manage an mk8s kubernetes cluster","ref":"/docs/reference/tasks/cloud/mk8s/","tags":"","title":"Mk8s"},{"body":"Check if a semver version A \u003e semver version B.
